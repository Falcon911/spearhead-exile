        ServerExeName = YourArmaExeName.exe

*** V 0.99.0 ***
- Fixed: Support for Multi homing ! hopefully the issue is fully resolved now.
- Fixed: Some exit messages was missing their sleep before auto-exiting. so you never saw the message before it quit. normal timeout is 4 sec.
- Fixed: bidkick command changed to bid and will ban instead of kick. its needs a BE id to be able to ban. use #beclient players to get the list
- Fixed: Minor Colorscheme issues.
- Fixed: Some code was improved for Heartbeat
- Fixed: Cleanup in General in the modules and classes.
- Fixed: Compiling script to include some missing info on details of app.        
- Added: kid command, will kick a player based on the Be Id
- Added: OPTION: AsciiOnly .auto kick players who uses None ascii chars in player name. example йфч.
         this might do jobs for admins on pub servers easier. especially if they don’t know how to type æøå or Cyrillic etc.
         but negative is might piss of players. when set to false. it uses utf8 ^^
         Note. players may still write with none ascii chars.
- Added: Splash. To disable splash. just rename or remove the splash.bmp file
- Added: Simple Icon on the exe
- Note bid and kid are base commands to be put in the Commands.xml file in the <cmd> </cmd> Tag
       those two commands are only useful if the player has some chars you cant type.
       you will need to use #beclient players to get the Id of the player

*** V 0.98.1 ***
- Added: Reimplemented Ip parameter, removing it broke multihome support.

*** V 0.98.0 ***  
- Added: Version Check, Bec will Notify you on startup if there is a newer version out.
- Added: Simple Parser check on the config file. only valid format is ANSI
- Added: Param check on the config file. in case some parameters are missing it will notify you. this is not the same as the parser check
- Changed: Hack reports from older versions are refused. keep bec up-to-date for hack reporting to work.
- Fixed: If Bec was running as a service. in example Firedaemon. when the Arma server was shutdown Bec didn't shutdown the reactor in itself.
- Fixed: Timec error.
- Fixed: File set in BeBanFile parameter should not be defined in [heartbeat]. its ignored if set.
- Fixed: Lower ranked admin can no longer exec kick or ban on a higher ranked admin even if they have permission to execute the command.
- Fixed: Equal ranked admins can only kick each other.Ban possible, Also. no ban on your self is no longer possible
- Removed: Ip as a parameter.. Hard coded ip 127.0.0.1
- Removed: StartTime as a parameter. Hard coded 15 seconds.
- Some other cleanup

*** V0.97.1 ***
- Fixed to get correct socket of arma server. there was a small bug in getting the correct one.

*** V 0.97.0 *** 
- Improved: New better function to check for the arma processes.
- Improved: Better Startup procedure. Bec will now first wait for the server exe, then wait for the server to create a socket before trying to login.
  in older versions of Bec, it tried to logon once it had found the server running. this caused problems since the socket was not always ready.
- Removed: deprecated parameter "serverparampath", people have a hard time understanding it anyway.
- Fixed: Relogin function was a bit messed up. Note. Bec will only relogin on corrupt data or if the client is no longer authorized
- Fixed: Socket did not close when no connection was established or possible to make... it just hang.

*** V 0.96.0 ***  
- Added: Console Colors. should work from win 2000 server and up.
- Added: Logging of execution on commands, it was only printing it to console before.
- Added: Tail of own Be Ban file.
- Added: Reload bans on Be Ban file Changes.
- Added: local heartbeat function. if a server is running multiple dedi servers, you can make bans work on all the servers.
  Heartbeat files are set by defining paths to your befiles and only new added bans are added. "its not a mirror"

*** V 0.95.0 ***
- Chat stored into separate file
- Be event-file only log Be events now. not clutter with chat anymore
