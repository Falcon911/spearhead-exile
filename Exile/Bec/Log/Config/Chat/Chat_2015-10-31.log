04:42:37 : Side: W E W L A D: Yes
04:42:49 : Side: W E W L A D: But it's against the rules to rearm in the safe zone.
04:42:58 : Side: W E W L A D: Gotta buy the crate and take it off somewhere
04:43:12 : Side: Justice: Where is that in the rules?
04:43:22 : Side: W E W L A D: Admins have said several times
04:43:32 : Side: W E W L A D: They come and delete them if they see you rearming in safe zones
04:43:54 : Side: Justice: Sounds like they need to update the rules
04:44:09 : Side: wolf: nothing here

04:56:21 : Side: Dackle2142: can the m107 use silencers ?

05:28:24 : Side: PFC Griffith: transparent aluminum and titanium
05:28:27 : Side: Austin: RHS and CUP weapons

05:30:12 : Side: PFC Griffith: no some other jack*** was in one earlier... flew by the base i was building.. and rained hell on me... then flew off didnt come for loot
05:30:13 : Side: Austin: the only thing with a gun that has thermals is the mk30HMG that requires 2 people to carry it and to shoot it you have to place it
05:30:24 : Side: PFC Griffith: just to troll by killing me and my car
05:30:38 : Side: PFC Griffith: but eh..
05:30:58 : Side: Remco: yeah but most of what i've seen is people ghillie up, take laser designator and a sniper rifle, hide in a bush until thermal spots osmeone.
05:30:58 : Side: Austin: had two apaches yesterday try and blow up the cars in my base, only took the wheels
05:31:34 : Side: Sam Ur Eye: thermals are forbidden in this server
05:31:49 : Side: Remco: its included in the laser designator...
05:31:52 : Side: Toby Larone: no they are not
05:31:55 : Side: Austin: thats why I don't do missions, someone always camping them waiting till you finish up then they kill you and take the loot
05:32:10 : Side: Austin: toby, thermal SCOPES
05:32:13 : Side: Austin: are bannable
05:32:18 : Side: Austin: ONLY SCOPES
05:32:36 : Side: PFC Griffith: why are they banable? there is no rule listed in the info
05:32:37 : Side: Austin: there are thermals an a few things that dont shoot, and only one that does
05:32:43 : Side: Toby Larone: ye thermal scopes are not in game but there are thermals on vehicles and items
05:32:46 : Side: Remco: banning scopes is a good start, but it should get taken out
05:32:52 : Side: Austin: they are out of the loot spawn
05:33:05 : Side: Austin: if you find and try to use one it will change into something else
05:33:16 : Side: Austin: pretty sure its an RCO
05:33:17 : Side: Toby Larone: there shouldnt be any thermals at all in game because it spoils it so much
05:33:29 : Side: PFC Griffith: tell that to the hind gunner
05:33:40 : Side: Toby Larone: they dont have thermal on hind
05:33:43 : Side: Austin: I think lazer desg. cost enough to be balanced, along with the uav
05:33:54 : Side: Austin: now the mk30HMG maybe shouldn't have them
05:34:01 : Side: Remco: it just ensures that high wealth people stya on top
05:34:20 : Side: Austin: go grind 50k in one night, its easy....
05:34:35 : Side: Toby Larone: how is it easy
05:34:36 : Side: PFC Griffith: shit you can grind 50k in a few hours if you know how
05:34:48 : Side: Austin: get a car that holds 4k, go somewhere quiet and collect alot of pistols
05:34:50 : Side: Remco: pyramid scams
05:34:58 : Side: Sam Ur Eye: just gather a ton of junk metla
05:35:26 : Side: Austin: and junk metal of course, but pistols are a higher mass/tab ratio
05:35:47 : Side: Remco: just make sure you bring thermal designator to ensure its actually quiet there :D
05:35:56 : Side: Toby Larone: fk thermals man
05:36:12 : Side: Remco: my point exactly
05:36:33 : Side: Toby Larone: everyones point i guess unless you cant play without them
05:36:35 : Side: Toxsick: yeah makes it tooez
05:36:42 : Side: PFC Griffith: you know you said the hind doesnt have thermals... ive no clue how they knew where i was in the forest earlier this evening then... 
05:37:00 : Side: Toby Larone: devil said they dont
05:37:01 : Side: PFC Griffith: unlike a hind to fly by over a thick forest at night... suddenly stop make a sharp turn come back and strafe me
05:37:03 : Side: W E W L A D: From alititude, you stand out like fcrazy.
05:37:05 : Side: PFC Griffith: but they did
05:37:10 : Side: PFC Griffith: ahh
05:37:10 : Side: W E W L A D: They don't have thermals.
05:37:12 : Side: Toby Larone: but if you move you can be seen
05:37:21 : Side: W E W L A D: Even standing still, it doesn't load details
05:37:32 : Side: PFC Griffith: so how come nobody has just destroyed dogs?
05:37:44 : Side: W E W L A D: he has "powers"
05:52:01 : Side: PFC Griffith: ooooh someone isnt going to be happy when they wake up tomorrow
05:52:15 : Side: Toxsick: y
05:52:17 : Side: PFC Griffith: they just lost there m1078a
05:52:36 : Side: PFC Griffith: it may be armored for the driver... but that fueltank is mighty weak
05:52:39 : Side: Toxsick: bases are industructible right?
05:52:53 : Side: PFC Griffith: yeah seems no server runs with destructable walls
05:53:00 : Side: PFC Griffith: can still shoot through them though
05:53:04 : Side: PFC Griffith: unless upgraded
05:53:14 : Side: Austin: dont raid a base unless the owner is online, you won't get very far
05:53:16 : Side: Remco: how much money needed to build a small room/base?
05:53:20 : Side: Toxsick: eh i miss taking ppls bses 
05:53:30 : Side: Austin: 5k for a 15m plot, 5k for a lock
05:53:53 : Side: Austin: you get a flagpole to place for the 5k
05:54:00 : Side: Toxsick: you gguys know that ccg zombie server? will their be free servers with zombies?
05:54:05 : Side: Remco: do you need to select where u wanna build first
05:54:11 : Side: Remco: or u can run around with the pole
05:54:50 : Side: Austin: you can actually build anywhere, there just isn't protection unless you pay for it, people can modify your stuff if you dont pay the protection
05:55:09 : Side: PFC Griffith: so anybody know what the 9P129-1M is for? or why its so damn expensive?
05:55:10 : Side: Austin: when you own land there is a rights system
05:55:26 : Side: Austin: what is it?
05:55:28 : Side: W E W L A D: It's the SCUD
05:55:32 : Side: Austin: oh that
05:55:34 : Side: PFC Griffith: oh a scud huh
05:55:35 : Side: W E W L A D: Because it's a SCUD
05:55:36 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: its a glorified boat
05:55:39 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: not a scud
05:55:40 : Side: Remco: thats complicated, I just want to build a shack in the woods
05:55:43 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: dont listen to them
05:55:55 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: its russias answer to america's technologically superior nuclear subs
05:56:06 : Side: Austin: the rights system is a whitelist for who can build at a flagpole
05:56:17 : Side: Austin: go to the teritory guy at a trader
05:56:22 : Side: Austin: you want the office
05:57:06 : Side: Remco: i only have 7,5k right now, im too poor, i should get more money so I can actually aquire more than a lock and a piece of dirt
05:57:23 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: make money dude
05:57:26 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: holla holla get dolla
05:57:42 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: gettin 16k every 20 mins
05:57:46 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: mmo life
05:57:53 : Side: Austin: costal trader, you can loot tons of houses while staying within 500m so nobody should be shooting you
05:58:14 : Side: |SGs| TC SILVER: how otto?
05:58:16 : Side: Austin: or just use an atv
05:58:22 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: its my secret recipe
05:58:25 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: killing ai
05:58:29 : Side: |SGs| TC SILVER: oh ok
05:58:42 : Side: PFC Griffith: a quad in the back of a truck?
05:58:43 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: just gotta do it in style
05:58:45 : Side: W E W L A D: There's a town full of ai in the West
05:58:54 : Side: W E W L A D: But they've got aimbot
05:58:57 : Side: Remco: picked up titan missile + launcer froma guy. cant even sell it :(
05:59:04 : Side: Austin: keeeep it
05:59:05 : Side: |SGs| TC SILVER: which town?
05:59:11 : Side: Remco: im gonna die before i can use it
05:59:16 : Side: W E W L A D: Roenne
05:59:27 : Side: Austin: get a tent and keeep it, they only come from missions
05:59:32 : Side: |SGs| TC SILVER: ty
05:59:42 : Side: W E W L A D: np
06:00:01 : Side: Austin: had two groups of AI the other night spotted on thermals in PERFECT TRIANGLE FORMATIONS less than 1k from my base
06:00:17 : Side: W E W L A D: View distance is only 600 here
06:00:37 : Side: Toxsick: random roaming ai?
06:00:41 : Side: Austin: then there was a bunch of pretty good loot where they were but they moved before I could get there on foot, I was flying a UAV
06:00:42 : Side: Toxsick: theres thermls on herE?
06:00:58 : Side: Austin: themal rangefinders eg lazer desg.
06:01:07 : Side: Toxsick: that show range?
06:01:09 : Side: Austin: there are thermals on the darter uav
06:01:16 : Side: Toxsick: ok
06:01:47 : Side: Austin: and the mk30HMG that carries in a backpack has a thermal/nv computerized sight on it
06:02:03 : Side: Remco: is that a deployable machine gun?
06:02:05 : Side: Austin: but that thing is better for base defense than anything
06:02:06 : Side: Austin: yes
06:02:15 : Side: Austin: 2 people needed, as it comes in 2 backpacks
06:02:29 : Side: Remco: so cant solo operate at all?
06:02:33 : Side: Austin: .50 BMG with 3 500rd mags
06:02:42 : Side: Austin: you can solo op if you keep it in your base
06:02:53 : Side: Austin: or lug it around in a car
06:03:57 : Side: Austin: the bipod they have in is pretty bad though, small fire arc and it sits really close to the ground, you sit when you shoot it, no cover at all
06:08:17 : Side: Toby Larone: who died at the mission, 2 guys in truck ?
06:08:40 : Side: W E W L A D: Two guys in a truck died.
06:09:05 : Side: Toby Larone: two guys in a pickup got killed who were they
06:09:22 : Side: Toby Larone: i watched it happen
06:14:13 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: there's one loudass chopper near the dealermission
06:15:00 : Side: W E W L A D: Which one?
06:15:03 : Side: W E W L A D: South or North?
06:15:16 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: north ;)
06:15:25 : Side: W E W L A D: shiet
06:15:31 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: is it you ? :D
06:15:34 : Side: W E W L A D: No
06:15:39 : Side: W E W L A D: But I'm near there
06:15:55 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: it landed tho, think they got out
06:16:05 : Side: W E W L A D: kk, waiting with strella
06:16:18 : Side: W E W L A D: if they go east they're going down
06:16:26 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: bu...
06:16:29 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: im going east ;_;
06:16:43 : Side: W E W L A D: you're not a chopper :)
06:16:44 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: guess its to kill or be killed :)
06:20:26 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: question.
06:20:45 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: who parked a red car aprox 630M from the north dealership_ >(
06:20:52 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: :)?*
06:22:57 : Side: Dackle2142: whos the apache guy ?
06:28:11 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: whos at the north dealership _
06:30:56 : Side: BFK: where are all the cars?
06:38:08 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: whoah ho
06:40:04 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: [distant 'it ain't me' starts playing]
06:44:32 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: IT AIN'T ME
06:45:45 : Side: Beau Jangles: fuck you dude, i was like 800m away from trader, why isnt there a rule notto stay within 1000m of a fucking trader. its bullshit!
06:47:02 : Side: W E W L A D: I'm guessing that was you  I heard get PCML'd?
06:48:04 : Side: Beau Jangles: nah a god damn chopper, what is this bullshit like ? there needs to be a no camp radius!
06:48:53 : Side: Zheky: They are and its 500
06:49:11 : Side: Beau Jangles: thats stupid!
06:59:10 : Side: Dackle2142: any admins on ?
06:59:17 : Side: W E W L A D: Why?
06:59:26 : Side: Dackle2142: flipped my car with the engine on
06:59:33 : Side: W E W L A D: There's an option to flip
06:59:34 : Side: Arttu Wiskari: check their TS
06:59:41 : Side: Dackle2142: you cant flip if its on
06:59:57 : Side: W E W L A D: DUnno
07:00:58 : Side: Dackle2142: fixed it
07:01:14 : Side: Dackle2142: time to resume the apachi hunt
07:01:26 : Side: W E W L A D: Where's the Apache at?
07:01:47 : Side: Dackle2142: idk ill just camp him
07:02:03 : Side: W E W L A D: I'll join you, I have titan
07:02:18 : Side: Dackle2142: im with an igla
07:02:28 : Side: W E W L A D: Airport or country?
07:02:41 : Side: Dackle2142: he flew over from country last time
07:02:47 : Side: Acki: whats the difference between offroad and offroad repair?
07:02:50 : Side: Dackle2142: now prolly from the mission
07:03:08 : Side: W E W L A D: Are you by country or airport?
07:03:11 : Side: W E W L A D: I'll wait at the other
07:03:17 : Side: Dackle2142: neither
07:03:26 : Side: Dackle2142: ill camp missions
07:03:39 : Side: Dackle2142: i dont want to grief him by camping traders
07:03:49 : Side: W E W L A D: Only one mission up
07:04:00 : Side: Dackle2142: he did that one
07:04:35 : Side: ChronicleDude: We should all suggest on the forum that they make it so the rearm pods dont work inside trader zones
07:04:50 : Side: W E W L A D: They delete them if they're in trader zones.
07:05:00 : Side: ChronicleDude: Yeah once every blue moon
07:05:02 : Side: W E W L A D: But the issue is they TP back to traders on restart if you move them
07:05:08 : Side: Austin: after a respawn don't they respawn at the trader for some reason?
07:05:13 : Side: W E W L A D: Yeah
07:05:14 : Side: Austin: yea
07:05:18 : Side: W E W L A D: So it's a losing battle.
07:05:25 : Side: ChronicleDude: Then they should add a rearm delay on the pods
07:05:28 : Side: ChronicleDude: 20 minutes
07:05:37 : Side: W E W L A D: That's not long enough
07:05:41 : Side: Austin: more than that I think. 30+
07:05:59 : Side: W E W L A D: The problem is that the BM-21 can be rearmed and continually fire off missles.
07:06:04 : Side: W E W L A D: Same with the scud
07:06:07 : Side: ChronicleDude: Just a way to stop the eternal grind of the attack choppers
07:06:08 : Side: W E W L A D: Their script doesn't work
07:06:16 : Side: W E W L A D: But no one has 60k+
07:06:19 : Side: Mstq: Anyone else getting seasick while driving a bike?
07:06:19 : Side: ChronicleDude: It is at the air trader
07:06:40 : Side: Austin: anyone survive driving a bike?
07:07:02 : Side: Mstq: I barely did just now :p
07:07:44 : Side: ChronicleDude: Wewlad you should stop grinding with that apache then :P
07:39:48 : Side: Dackle2142: mmm is that an apachi ?
07:40:05 : Side: John Cena: Apache*
07:40:13 : Side: Dackle2142: oh shit
07:40:22 : Side: Dackle2142: i like apachi more
07:40:28 : Side: John Cena: k
07:40:31 : Side: John Cena: Where is it?
07:40:45 : Side: Dackle2142: i think going towards country 
07:40:56 : Side: John Cena: Where did you see it?
07:41:12 : Side: Dackle2142: moving north to south
07:41:21 : Side: John Cena: Near what down, jesus
07:41:36 : Side: John Cena: oh, it's over me in Nexoe
07:41:38 : Side: Dackle2142: qesterlars
07:41:47 : Side: Dackle2142: cool
07:43:39 : Side: John Cena: It's hovering around Nexoe for some reason
07:44:16 : Side: Austin: if I were in an apache I would totally fuck with john cena
07:44:23 : Side: John Cena: :(
07:44:27 : Side: Dackle2142: i wouldnt
07:44:39 : Side: Dackle2142: he is john fucking cena

07:49:51 : Side: Cerin: as long as the beast isnt going to kill me
07:49:57 : Side: ricky de-canta: the m107a2 or something
07:50:08 : Side: Madora The Explora: Armed HUMVEE?

07:52:12 : Side: Bananapowah: why cant i buy anything in the store?
07:52:19 : Side: John Cena: Because God hates you.
07:52:24 : Side: Bananapowah: >*
07:52:31 : Side: Bananapowah: why good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
07:52:43 : Side: Bananapowah: god*
07:52:50 : Side: Rusty: because you haven't surrendered your soul to the dark lord Satan

07:53:08 : Side: Bananapowah: wtf
07:53:12 : Side: Rusty: clearly not
07:55:23 : Side: Austin: cool rocket, on a fuel van?
07:55:44 : Side: Rusty: that... would be a SCUD missile
07:55:48 : Side: Jakulta: it was moving
07:55:59 : Side: Rusty: RIP someone's base, if the owner is competent
07:56:06 : Side: Austin: no, someone wasted a rocket on a fuel van
07:56:08 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: scud where
07:56:12 : Side: Rusty: ahhh ok
07:56:15 : Side: Rusty: nevermind
07:56:20 : Side: Rusty: yeah that's dumb
07:56:48 : Side: Rusty: unless they are absurdly wealthy
07:57:18 : Side: Austin: then whats to gain from doing that? my probs 700 tabs sell value in gear?
07:57:46 : Side: Rusty: touche
07:57:47 : Side: Rusty: still dumb
07:57:50 : Side: Jakulta: reading side chat is all it takes to be worth it
07:57:55 : Side: Austin: I guess
07:58:42 : Side: Austin: still I was only using it to get somewhere, trader wasnt even the original idea, now ill chute in close enough
08:00:52 : Side: Matt Petro: how do you open that tablet thingy
08:01:09 : Side: Jakulta: press 6
08:01:16 : Side: Matt Petro: tanks
08:01:18 : Side: Matt Petro: thanks*

08:03:04 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: lmao fail apache 
08:03:07 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: just hit a tree
08:03:24 : Side: John Cena: What a dumbass, LOL. I fraps'ed that.
08:08:33 : Side: blrScribbles: how do you craft a door upgrade kit?
08:08:56 : Side: Rusty: select your doorway, recipes
08:10:22 : Side: blrScribbles: thanks
08:11:01 : Side: ChronicleDude: Optima is there a way to remove the rearm pods? the respect grind from choppers is unreal
08:15:32 : Side: Bananapowah: admin
08:17:18 : Side: Bananapowah: our truck has despawnd
08:17:21 : Side: Bananapowah: ...
08:17:24 : Side: Jakulta: rip rip
08:17:40 : Side: Austin: nice message optima
08:24:08 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: who bought this armored truck
08:24:38 : Side: Jamal Jackson: me 
08:29:42 : Side: John Cena: Still hunting your Apachi?
08:30:34 : Side: Optima: btw dont buy the apache, it will be replaced probably later today
08:30:49 : Side: ChronicleDude: By what?
08:30:49 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: by what
08:30:53 : Side: WO2. A.Barton: cobra?
08:30:53 : Side: John Cena: Optima, come down to TS channel 13 please then
08:30:55 : Side: Rusty: yeah! by what?
08:30:55 : Side: Jamal Jackson: replaced with a kitten?
08:30:59 : Side: Optima: Ah-1Z
08:31:02 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: can i opt in for a trade in program
08:31:04 : Side: John Cena: Cobra, k
08:31:05 : Side: ChronicleDude: Remove the rearm pods 
08:31:05 : Side: Beau Jangles: optima, you an admin?
08:31:06 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: since i bought this last night
08:31:11 : Side: ChronicleDude: so they cant use them all the time
08:31:29 : Side: WO2. A.Barton: so the cobra...
08:32:04 : Side: Optima: the cobra is way more balanced
08:32:13 : Side: John Cena: Why do you say that?
08:32:22 : Side: John Cena: What makes it more balanced? No hud/radar?
08:32:28 : Side: Zheky: cause we tested it
08:32:52 : Side: Zheky: it goes down like a sack of rocks with one missle hit
08:32:54 : Side: Optima: because its true, No lock on missiles, and you can actually take it down without needing TITAN AA
08:33:03 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: wait does it tear up the rotor
08:33:22 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: if the thing cant autorotate, may as well buy a hind
08:33:31 : Side: Dackle2142: will it be cheaper than the hind then ?
08:33:37 : Side: John Cena: 25k?
08:33:38 : Side: Optima: ofc it can autorotate
08:33:42 : Side: Zheky: its arma 3 everything autorotates
08:33:52 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: well you said it goes down like a sack of bricks
08:33:54 : Side: John Cena: everything autorotates poorly*
08:34:01 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: reminds me of when helis lost their rotor in early builds
08:34:10 : Side: ChronicleDude: Optima will the rearm pods stil be there?
08:34:16 : Side: Optima: i dont know
08:34:23 : Side: ChronicleDude: They are the biggest issue 
08:34:30 : Side: John Cena: At least fix it where they don't teleport back to the trade.
08:34:30 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: can i get a refund for the apache or a trade in later then

09:02:00 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: not for long
09:02:01 : Side: Austin: not for long
09:02:16 : Side: Jamal Jackson: Otto, you do know that it has thermals, and a 3km playerfinder
09:02:17 : Side: YourAngelTonight: oh rgr, ty for the info tho :P
09:02:30 : Side: Zheky: thermals are off
09:02:47 : Side: Jamal Jackson: what do you mean by thermals are off?
09:02:48 : Side: Optima: no thermals
09:02:57 : Side: Jamal Jackson: since when?
09:03:08 : Side: Optima: since always, we disabled it
09:03:29 : Side: Mr Ghillie: laser des?
09:03:37 : Side: Optima: yes
09:03:47 : Side: WO2. A.Barton: he ment they were disabled on apaches not laser
09:03:51 : Side: Jamal Jackson: so what about the radar and the missiles? 
09:03:55 : Side: John Cena: Those are gone
09:03:55 : Side: Mr Ghillie: ah ok
09:04:03 : Side: John Cena: No radar
09:04:22 : Side: Optima: the thermals are disabled on the apache, the laser designator still have thermals
09:04:53 : Side: Liam: how come yous decided to keep thermals in laser des?
09:05:05 : Side: Mr Ghillie: cus u need to switch>
09:05:12 : Side: Jamal Jackson: because they can't be weaponised as much i gues
09:05:13 : Side: Mr Ghillie: and it takes time i guess lol
09:05:17 : Side: Mr Ghillie: ^
09:05:20 : Side: Jamal Jackson: since the apache is overpowered anyway
09:05:22 : Side: Mr Ghillie: unlike the night stalker
09:05:44 : Side: Az0: is there an issue with the server? I can't buy a car
09:05:45 : Side: Mr Ghillie: 3 types of thermals and a built in range finder
09:06:10 : Side: ChronicleDude: Just remove the rearm pods then the coppers and tanks will be just fine on rearm per restart
09:06:58 : Side: Liam: i still find the thermals are wuite unfair even in the laser designator i find i can see anyone in my area through just a quick scan
09:08:25 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: who was that
09:08:47 : Side: Austin: super cool slam mine, too bad it missed
09:09:05 : Side: Az0: I bought a car, my money disappeared but I can't find the vehicle

10:19:45 : Side: Austin: prepare ye iglas
10:19:56 : Side: Nocturnal Chang: I think 40k would have been a bit more modest... but its a cobra none the less
10:20:21 : Side: Austin: it has air to air
10:20:35 : Side: theninja35: It can blow holes in bases.
10:20:35 : Side: Gaming_Grunt: so what happened to those who had apaches?
10:20:49 : Side: Bluegill: i like this server's 1st person only, puts you in the game
10:20:54 : Side: Austin: those who still have them should still, until they get shot down
10:21:02 : Side: Bluegill: the immertion~
10:21:13 : Side: Gaming_Grunt: hunt down the endangered apaches!!!
10:21:14 : Side: Austin: until you see a fish swim across the street
10:21:31 : Side: Bluegill: lol so true
10:21:38 : Side: Fisherman23gp: admin
10:21:42 : Side: Fisherman23gp: i have a problem
10:21:55 : Side: Fisherman23gp: i got off my strider and it glitched me into a base
10:22:09 : Side: theninja35: You did that on purpose and now you're stuck.
10:22:14 : Side: Fisherman23gp: no
10:22:15 : Side: Joey: lol
10:22:24 : Side: FamishedBurrito: thats VERRY hard to do on accident
10:22:25 : Side: Fisherman23gp: i wanted to go into this building to take out the mission
10:22:32 : Side: Fisherman23gp: and i didnt realize there was a base
10:22:33 : Side: theninja35: Then how can you accidentally park next to a base and accidentally glitch through.
10:22:40 : Side: theninja35: Then you're blind, you deserved it.
10:22:43 : Side: FamishedBurrito: did you not see the giant base? so you got out of your car next to the wall you didnt see
10:22:49 : Side: Fisherman23gp: its not giant
10:22:51 : Side: theninja35: Looks like you're waiting until the owners shoot you.
10:23:03 : Side: Fisherman23gp: should i try to glitch out?
10:23:05 : Side: Jakulta: whats changed since last restart?
10:23:30 : Side: theninja35: Cobras instead of Apaches.
10:23:32 : Side: theninja35: That's it I think.
10:23:41 : Side: Jakulta: kk
10:23:57 : Side: Gaming_Grunt: how much are the cobras?
10:24:17 : Side: theninja35: Probably like 50k
10:25:07 : Side: Nocturnal Chang: The cobra is 50k, but it is worse statistically than the hind, so imo it should be lowered in price
10:25:25 : Side: theninja35: Someone said it has AA missiles
10:25:31 : Side: Austin: lock on ATA
10:25:47 : Side: Zheky: it does i help optimia test it yesterday

10:40:48 : Side: Optima: yea we are trying to figure out if we can do limited rearms.
10:41:08 : Side: Jakulta: disable rearm at trader

10:41:18 : Side: Jakulta: 5min rearm time
10:41:21 : Side: Fisherman23gp: how do you rearm
10:41:22 : Side: ChronicleDude: Isnt it so that when the server restarts all ammo gets replaced on choppers
10:41:30 : Side: Jakulta: 90% of the people using it will not know what to do anymore
10:41:36 : Side: Optima: imo, they should be removed completly, but its not my desicion.
10:41:37 : Side: ChronicleDude: If you just remove the pods it will rearm every time th server restart
10:41:45 : Side: ChronicleDude: Optima for president!
10:42:00 : Side: theninja35: If rearm pods are removed then I think every heavily armed vehicle should go down in cost.
10:42:04 : Side: Zheky: optimia 2016
10:42:10 : Side: theninja35: Including air vehiclesd.
10:42:14 : Side: ChronicleDude: Nah higher cost
10:42:30 : Side: ChronicleDude: Conserve ammo whe you have them!
10:42:39 : Side: Jakulta: high cost = a chance on foot or in lightly armored stuff
10:42:42 : Side: ChronicleDude: 76 rockets can kill alot of people
10:42:49 : Side: theninja35: If you're paying for a limited use then the prices should lower, though.
10:42:58 : Side: ChronicleDude: 50k aint expensive
10:43:00 : Side: Zheky: no 
10:43:08 : Side: ChronicleDude: 1 day and you have 50k
10:43:30 : Side: Zheky: i made 25k loot run the other day so 50k is cheap
10:43:34 : Side: theninja35: The ammunition count can be lowered manually as well.
10:44:11 : Side: Optima: i could talk with falcon about a rearm"trader" so you have to pay to rearm.
10:44:29 : Side: Optima: dunno if its possible tho
10:44:35 : Side: Fisherman23gp: you should
10:44:35 : Side: Jakulta: anything is better than what we have now
10:44:36 : Side: ChronicleDude: If the price is expensive as F then yeah
10:44:40 : Side: theninja35: They do it on wasteland, not sure why you couldn't do it here.
10:44:55 : Side: Sniper_foe: you should see if you can bring back AI invasion towns those were fun 
10:45:03 : Side: ChronicleDude: 15000 to rearm a attack helo
10:45:15 : Side: theninja35: I was thinking 10k.
10:45:21 : Side: Optima: price would depend on what weapon systems.
10:45:32 : Side: Fisherman23gp: wait if 10k to rearm attack helo
10:45:32 : Side: ChronicleDude: cheaper for blackhawk seense it have no rockets
10:45:42 : Side: Optima: exactly
10:45:55 : Side: ChronicleDude: rockets should be expensive a F
10:45:56 : Side: Fisherman23gp: would it still rearm if the server restarts?
10:46:12 : Side: theninja35: Yeah, I don't think there's a work around.
10:46:14 : Side: Zheky: yes i would leave that be 
10:54:58 : Side: Bluegill: where is all the typical action?

18:58:50 : Side: Wolfy: Did some testing
18:58:55 : Side: Wolfy: Armour is SUPER poor
18:59:02 : Side: Wolfy: Glass isn't armoured
18:59:08 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: apache's wasnt either
18:59:16 : Side: Wolfy: Took 5 rounds from and M4, engine was gone
18:59:24 : Side: Wolfy: It was from the front
18:59:35 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: its a glass cannon with 76 or so hydras and thats all i care about
18:59:54 : Side: Wolfy: True
18:59:59 : Side: Wolfy: It's pretty nimble too
19:00:12 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: Still has a HUD and can lock onto other aircraft

19:00:53 : Direct: Wolfy: May I get in?
19:01:08 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: the only thing that can stop me now is arma physics
19:01:20 : Side: Wolfy: Autorotation in it is easy
19:01:22 : Side: Optima: and my sidewinders
19:01:33 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: its easy in general
19:01:38 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: until you slide 5 feet and arma decides you blow up
19:01:50 : Side: Wolfy: Us pilots should stick together, us good pilots are worth our weight in gold :3
19:02:09 : Side: Wolfy: It's pretty agile, very responsive and easy to land
19:02:11 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: i await the tears as i blanket bases and missions with hyrdas
19:02:58 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: plus i can look behind me in the cobra
19:02:59 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: lel

19:03:39 : Side: Wolfy: How?
19:03:49 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: TrackIR or ctrl + numpad keys
19:03:50 : Side: Crumplypanda: was the sever under repair cause it disapeared
19:03:55 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: Only works in helis i think

19:50:55 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: its 50k it should be op

19:51:11 : Side: daniel: 50k is easy as fuck to gety
19:51:12 : Side: Jakulta: cost is not a balancing factor for OP items
19:51:18 : Side: ChronicleDude: some people have way to much cash
19:51:25 : Side: daniel: 50k is way to easy to get
19:51:27 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: it kinda is

19:51:32 : Side: daniel: shud be tripple

19:51:36 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: or 200k
19:51:39 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: 100k is too much
19:51:44 : Side: FamishedBurrito: last question.. if i place a safe without buying a plot of land, will it delete?
19:51:44 : Side: Jakulta: 1m
19:51:46 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: if its op then make it expensive
19:51:50 : Side: Genox: Anybody else having trouble unlocking there vehicle?
19:51:53 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: 100k would be fair for like
19:51:53 : Side: Madden: 150 is where it should be at
19:51:55 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: an abrams
19:51:56 : Side: daniel: no
19:52:01 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: but even an abrams will get destroyed by a cobra
19:52:04 : Side: Madden: just hard enough to make you think twice
19:52:06 : Side: John: just stop whining about it and play the game
19:52:11 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: any fights going on anywhere atm?

19:53:54 : Side: AMAYA: admin
19:53:59 : Side: ChronicleDude: My question is still do they get cash for it
19:54:03 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: yeah
19:54:04 : Side: YourAngelTonight: Do cobras actually have flares or did they remove them?
19:54:09 : Side: AMAYA: i spawned and fall of the world
19:54:13 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: no heli's have flares
19:54:18 : Side: AMAYA: lost all my gear
19:54:21 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: if the cobra had no countermeasures itd be pointless to buy
19:54:32 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: well the hind doesnt
19:54:39 : Side: YourAngelTonight: ^
19:54:45 : Side: OttoTheAutopilot: yes it does

19:55:56 : Side: AMAYA: in my base
19:55:58 : Side: Jakulta: find new if you cant find the old
19:56:15 : Side: Jakulta: it takes 5-10min to get enough caps to buy whatever you want
19:56:16 : Side: AMAYA: ...
19:56:45 : Side: Jakulta: unless you want to use insanely priced gear that dont give any extra benefit
19:56:57 : Direct: Bates: Heya sniper whatcha doin
19:57:20 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: well im pretty sure someone with an m107 has an advantage over someone with a 5.56
19:57:28 : Side: KrostiPanel: Why don't i have the option to unlock/lock my car?
19:57:38 : Side: FamishedBurrito: so use their sniper rifle agaisnt them and flank?
19:58:05 : Side: Jakulta: jonty, m107 is not the only 1 shot kill weapon, you can get a silenced one that cost alot less
19:58:12 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: i know
19:58:19 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: its just the most expensive
19:58:26 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: he was going by cost
19:58:30 : Side: Jakulta: 5.56 is NOT the onlything you can buy for nothing, most of them cost more than better weapons
19:58:37 : Side: O. Cammy: whose on the city where the cobra is shooting at?
19:58:50 : Side: James: what city?
