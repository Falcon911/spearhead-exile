17:27:41 : Side: theninja35: You were right there.
17:27:43 : Side: AvengedCanadian: the role back saved your money
17:27:49 : Side: Austin: lol no it did not
17:27:51 : Side: AvengedCanadian: because vehicles were not staying
17:27:54 : Side: Legitawesome: Not for me
17:27:59 : Side: AvengedCanadian: so in the long run it did
17:28:00 : Side: Legitawesome: I lost all my gear too
17:28:03 : Side: Austin: I know that, I was grinding for the last 4 hours
17:28:10 : Side: Joey: so this is the old server and everything
17:28:18 : Side: Lane LeBron: austin shut the fuck up take it up with admines
17:28:25 : Side: Lane LeBron: admins
17:28:27 : Side: Austin: dude calm down
17:28:32 : Side: Lane LeBron: plus its not really
17:28:33 : Side: Legitawesome: Who was in the Heli in Vester

17:28:39 : Side: Austin: you think I don't know that?
17:28:40 : Side: Lane LeBron: that hard to loot up
17:28:40 : Side: Joey: Admins
17:28:47 : Side: Joey: Is this the final server
17:28:48 : Side: Legitawesome: OH
17:28:49 : Side: Lane LeBron: then stop complaining to us
17:28:52 : Side: really bro: no
17:28:59 : Side: really bro: this is temporary
17:29:00 : Side: Austin: wow someone is mad
17:29:00 : Side: James: Pls stfu
17:29:01 : Side: Joey: its not?
17:29:22 : Side: Lane LeBron: nah just people dont want spammers in caht about a problem they can take up on ts
17:29:26 : Side: theninja35: Both you, Joey, and Austin were on the server just before they reset it to the other. Can you not fucking read?
17:29:27 : Side: Lane LeBron: caht
17:29:35 : Side: Lane LeBron: chat*
17:29:36 : Side: really bro: caht spell
17:29:41 : Side: Joey: I can read
17:29:49 : Side: Wolfy: Long story short, new update coming that requires a game wipe, admins aren't sure if they wanna do it, plus they reverted because of the vehicles
17:29:51 : Side: theninja35: Then know that they reset it to the old story.
17:29:53 : Side: Lane LeBron: wasnt talking to you kids
17:30:01 : Side: theninja35: Server, not story.
17:30:05 : Side: theninja35: I'm having a stroke because of this.
17:30:14 : Side: Joey: Ok i wasnt paying attention man my bad
17:30:18 : Side: Wolfy: People are idiots
17:30:39 : Side: theninja35: This would be far worse if the server was still on A3Launcher
17:30:57 : Side: Wolfy: A3 launcher is awful, such bad download speeds
17:31:04 : Side: theninja35: Most of the mods are on Steam
17:31:19 : Side: theninja35: But I still get around 3-4MB/s on a3Launcher, only 2 less than Steam
17:31:30 : Side: Wolfy: I get 1kbs on A3
17:31:35 : Side: James: likewise
17:31:47 : Side: Wolfy: And like... 50mb/s on steam
17:31:49 : Side: theninja35: I do too when it first begins downloading. But after around 5 minutes it knows.
17:32:35 : Side: Joey: so they have 2 servers
17:32:48 : Side: Wolfy: No, they're reverting to this server for now
17:32:51 : Side: theninja35: No, they have on public Exile server that you are on currently.
17:32:52 : Side: Legitawesome: TS just died?
17:32:52 : Side: Joey: oh

17:33:27 : Side: Vector: trying to get the pin back for a truck that my buddy purchased yeasterday he also stopped playing yesterday so i kinda need that pin now lol
17:33:47 : Side: Lane LeBron: why not ask him for it 
17:33:49 : Side: Lane LeBron: ?
17:34:02 : Side: Vector: thats what im doing hes not responding atm
17:34:10 : Side: theninja35: Because his buddy died but it's not actually his buddy's truck.
17:34:39 : Side: Joey: So they have 2 servers one public that is working, and they are trying to fix the other server for this data to go on there?
17:34:40 : Side: Vector: I found it ironic cuz i ran across the map

18:51:58 : Side: Gunnbjofur: Get an F-35 so the engine can catch on fire
18:51:58 : Side: Genox: F-35s are the shittiest aircraft ever built.
18:51:58 : Side: ODDBALL: F18 Hornet?
18:52:02 : Side: Wolfy: +
18:52:07 : Side: Wolfy: F-35 is bad

18:55:35 : Side: Genox: B-61s are the closest thing to a "Tactical nuke"
18:55:43 : Side: Wolfy: That's not really "Tactical"
18:56:01 : Side: Jessix Stiller: tactical just means small
18:56:07 : Side: Jessix Stiller: small blast
