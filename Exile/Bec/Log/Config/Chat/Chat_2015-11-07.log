13:55:19 : Side: ChronicleDude: I spent so much money on trying to shoot you down
13:55:36 : Side: ChronicleDude: Flared 6 missiles from the stinger 
13:55:46 : Side: Dackle2142: well that wasnt me then lol
13:56:00 : Side: Dackle2142: i only flared 2 rockets before my sad death
13:56:07 : Side: Dackle2142: real good flares on that thing
13:56:21 : Side: ChronicleDude: I dont really get how to shoot at the choppers
13:56:38 : Side: ChronicleDude: when im in my chopper i get popped so many times >-<
13:56:40 : Side: Dackle2142: its hard
13:56:50 : Side: ChronicleDude: But when i fire at somone else they just go on flying :P
13:57:04 : Side: Dackle2142: they are not worth im
13:57:06 : Side: Dackle2142: imo
13:57:32 : Side: ChronicleDude: But im trying kinda hard to get the rearm pods removed from trader zones and remove the cash from doing missions with the choppers
13:57:51 : Side: ChronicleDude: I dont like that people can just buy a chopper then print cash
13:58:02 : Side: Dackle2142: its not like that :D
13:58:04 : Side: ChronicleDude: 1 rearm pod is 1000 poptabs
13:58:06 : Side: Dackle2142: its not worth
13:58:14 : Side: ChronicleDude: one missil is 1500
13:58:17 : Side: EbolaPepsiCola: its pretty easy to take a chopper down too
13:58:29 : Side: ChronicleDude: I cant get it down :P
13:58:38 : Side: ChronicleDude: Fired 6x1500
13:58:42 : Side: ChronicleDude: up in the air today
13:58:53 : Side: ChronicleDude: on 2 diffrent cobras
13:59:00 : Side: Sean: has any one seen that van with a gun on the top on it it killed me like 30mins
13:59:04 : Side: Sean: ?
13:59:12 : Side: ChronicleDude: Sorry Sean havent seen it
13:59:28 : Side: Sean: ok i want to fuck it up!!!!!
13:59:42 : Side: ChronicleDude: They should add a rearm cost 10-15k to rarm choppers
13:59:58 : Side: EbolaPepsiCola: and for the bm21
14:00:01 : Side: ChronicleDude: Makes it less profitable to wipe all the missions all the time
14:00:10 : Side: ChronicleDude: I dont mind the ground vehicles
14:00:14 : Side: ChronicleDude: They are easy to take out
14:00:24 : Side: ChronicleDude: and people inside them see very little
14:00:29 : Side: EbolaPepsiCola: it just launches rockets everywhere from like anywhere tho lol
14:00:29 : Side: scott: air is not the same that cost alot to deal with
14:00:34 : Side: EbolaPepsiCola: its such easy farming
14:00:51 : Side: ChronicleDude: Yeah arty should just be removed all together
14:01:09 : Side: commanderoz: lol how am i still alive
14:01:17 : Side: ChronicleDude: Buy a scud sit in safe sone near a pod print poptabs.
14:01:19 : Side: commanderoz: chopper guy really wants me dead
14:06:22 : Side: commanderoz: geeze he leveled half the airfield tring to kill me
14:07:04 : Side: Kroonch: thats a fucking joke, it costs 1000 to rearm a heli
14:07:16 : Side: ChronicleDude: Yeah 
14:07:23 : Side: ChronicleDude: 1500 for the launcher
14:07:33 : Side: Michael S. Gambino: still pretty cheap
14:07:39 : Side: ChronicleDude: Cheape?!
14:07:42 : Side: ChronicleDude: ITs free
14:07:51 : Side: ChronicleDude: for the chopper
14:07:55 : Side: Michael S. Gambino: do a mission and you can rearm it twice
14:08:01 : Side: ChronicleDude: The launcher is expensive
14:08:13 : Side: Michael S. Gambino: 6 ai kills is 3k
14:08:24 : Side: Jakulta: 1k for the rearm container, or use a free one that someone else payed for
14:08:25 : Side: ChronicleDude: chopper can rearm for free.
14:08:33 : Side: ChronicleDude: Kill no ai
14:08:41 : Side: ChronicleDude: And rearm forever
14:08:45 : Side: Michael S. Gambino: so wats expensive then
14:08:52 : Side: ChronicleDude: The launcher ammo
14:08:59 : Side: Jakulta: costing 3x to get a single chance to shoot a heli compared to what a heli cost to ream when you can earn money with it
14:09:03 : Side: Michael S. Gambino: its the same theory
14:09:06 : Side: ChronicleDude: Is expensive compared to the cost the choppers have to do
14:09:13 : Side: Michael S. Gambino: kill 6 ai and 3k is comming ure way
14:09:26 : Side: ChronicleDude: You dont get what i want to say
14:09:30 : Side: ChronicleDude: if i take a chopper
14:09:35 : Side: ChronicleDude: and you take a weapon
14:09:43 : Side: Jakulta: so if 3k is "cheap" for a try to kill a heli, wouldnt 20k be cheap to rearm the heli?
14:09:50 : Side: ChronicleDude: i have unlimited with ammo i move around 335km hr 
14:10:02 : Side: ChronicleDude: i kill all missions before you get out of trader zone
14:10:25 : Side: |SGs| TC SILVER: what chopper you got?
14:10:41 : Side: ChronicleDude: I can buy whatever chopper i want
14:10:57 : Side: ChronicleDude: seense i have been an asshat and killing of all the missions earlier today
14:10:58 : Side: Kroonch: in other words the economy is broken

14:11:57 : Side: scott: except you need to earn the money to buy them first
14:11:57 : Side: ChronicleDude: That i can fly around killing all the missions and people on the ground cant do shit about it
14:12:00 : Side: commanderoz: add AI with AA, problem solved
14:12:02 : Side: |SGs| TC SILVER: is you base north west EC guys?
14:12:08 : Side: Big Dawg: chronical, you will only fly over one gang and you wont have a chopper anymore...everyone has stingers now

16:57:08 : Group: Agent 48: this is taking longer than it should
16:57:13 : Side: Fisherman23gp: exile help and support is empty
16:57:53 : Side: Jakulta: dont matter, if you need help the dedicated spot for help is where you start looking for admin to help

16:59:32 : Side: Zoulja: missions are fine, but they need to add more AA
16:59:46 : Side: FamishedBurrito: AI AA would be terrible
16:59:48 : Side: Zoulja: problem is people roll up in attack choppers and blast everyone within 5 minutes of mission being up
16:59:51 : Side: Strelok: can we a10's?
16:59:55 : Side: Strelok: brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
