10:33:41 : Side: Madora The Explora: Gotta love retards who jump off buildings and blow your vans up...
10:33:44 : Side: greg: so why did you say it?
10:33:56 : Side: Glassman823: I said thank you for not killing me right off
10:33:58 : Side: Glassman823: I was being literal
10:34:00 : Side: greg: ohhhh
10:34:05 : Side: greg: i thought you said thank you for killing me 
10:34:08 : Side: greg: i misread lol
10:34:50 : Side: Carniverious: errr merrr gerrrrd the bubbles are back!
10:35:02 : Side: greg: bubbles?
10:35:21 : Side: Carniverious: peripheral bubbles that tell you a vic or something is near
10:35:21 : Side: greg: traders are safe havens right?
10:36:21 : Side: Glassman823: The struggle between keeping a 5.56 that has a supressor
10:36:24 : Side: Glassman823: Or upgrading to 6.5
10:36:34 : Side: Bogus: upgrade dude
10:36:41 : Side: Glassman823: Eventually
10:36:49 : Side: Glassman823: I'd rather be supressed atm, since my grip isn't on lol
10:36:52 : Side: Glassman823: group*
10:37:55 : Side: Glassman823: Who was that I talked to btw? That had the supressed katiba?
10:39:10 : Side: Lane LeBron: wtf is this i cant elevate this wood floor? do i have to be by work bench to elevate?
10:39:21 : Side: Glassman823: No
10:39:25 : Side: Glassman823: It's a glitch, redo it
10:39:38 : Side: greg: m4 is 556 right?
10:39:42 : Side: Glassman823: Correct
10:39:42 : Side: greg: should i buy an m4 or a m16?
10:39:48 : Side: Glassman823: M4 is more reliable
10:40:05 : Side: Bogus: M16 has better accuracy
10:40:20 : Side: greg: is the m68 scope the one thats scope and red dot?
10:40:23 : Side: Glassman823: Honestly comes down to if you want full auto or not
10:40:26 : Side: Bogus: yep
10:40:56 : Side: Lane LeBron: what do you mean re do it glassman
10:41:11 : Side: Glassman823: As in cancel out, and redo the grid
10:41:14 : Side: Glassman823: If it does it again, relog
10:41:24 : Side: Lane LeBron: k thanks
10:41:30 : Side: Glassman823: Np
10:41:30 : Side: greg: m4 is 556 30 rd stanag right?
10:41:33 : Side: Carniverious: someone in a plane?
10:41:37 : Side: Glassman823: Correct
10:41:40 : Side: greg: i have like 6 mags in my backpack how come its only showing i have 1 clip
10:41:45 : Side: Carniverious: nvm an apache
10:41:50 : Side: Glassman823: Might need a special clip on this server
10:41:56 : Side: Optima: cOBRA*
10:42:03 : Side: Carniverious: oh cobras now?
10:42:04 : Side: Glassman823: There's a tab for you to search ammo on in the trader menu
10:42:04 : Side: Jamal Jackson: greg, are they for the correct gun?
10:42:15 : Side: greg: well my m4 is a 5.56 x45
10:42:29 : Side: Optima: naa just me playing around
10:42:35 : Side: Carniverious: lol
10:42:35 : Side: greg: and i have 4 of those in my backpack
10:42:36 : Side: Jamal Jackson: the m4 only takes RHS ammo i think
10:42:44 : Side: Carniverious: nope
10:42:47 : Side: Jamal Jackson: so it may not work without being RHS
10:42:47 : Side: greg: im looking at the mag thats in my gun now
10:42:49 : Side: Bogus: try the RHS mk262 ammo
10:42:50 : Side: Carniverious: it takes the regular 5.56
10:42:52 : Side: greg: says 5.56 stanag mag
10:43:02 : Side: Bogus: Greg try MK262 ammo
10:43:04 : Side: Bogus: in RHS ammo
10:43:09 : Side: Glassman823: Sounds like one of your mods isn't working right
10:43:15 : Side: Carniverious: oh so MK262 is RHS?
10:43:21 : Side: Carniverious: yeah Im using the 262 lol
10:43:26 : Side: Jamal Jackson: greg, just try the MK262 ammo that is in the RHS ammo section 
10:43:28 : Side: Glassman823: There's a mod on the server that is supposed to address the incapatibilty issue
10:43:55 : Side: Glassman823: ASDGR I think it's called?
10:44:03 : Side: Bogus: hello optima
10:44:08 : Side: Optima: yo :D
10:44:13 : Side: Coldman662: asdg jr
10:44:38 : Side: Optima: the Cobra could be the replacement for the Apache
10:44:49 : Side: Bogus: whats the difference?
10:45:01 : Group: Carniverious: cobra is smaller for sure
10:45:04 : Side: Lane LeBron: i go to grid mode to elevate would right?
10:45:07 : Side: Madden: Awe man, who killed me at the Humanitarian ?
10:45:09 : Side: Carniverious: cobra is smaller for sure
10:45:20 : Side: Optima: lots. easier to take out, more simple weapon systems, no lock on missiles
10:45:25 : Side: Glassman823: I'm prretty sure it's page up and down, but don't quote me. Haven't built in a solid minute.
10:45:31 : Side: greg: the blue ammo is the ones compat with what i carry right?
10:45:39 : Side: Lane LeBron: k
10:45:49 : Side: Madden: Whos at the completed mission ?
10:45:51 : Side: Lane LeBron: like on the arrow keys or keypad
10:45:53 : Side: Bogus: that would be better In my opinion
10:46:11 : Side: Glassman823: Page up and down. Unless it's changed, or I'm misremembering it.
10:47:09 : Side: Optima: yes, the ground supression cobra i was flying has hydras, the cannon and 2 sidewinders, thats it, and one missile from the igla will take it down
10:47:10 : Side: Glassman823: The coastal trader sells gear correct?
10:47:12 : Side: greg: g17 is 9m?
10:47:15 : Side: Madden: Who just killed the guy @ the mission with the ifrit 
10:47:15 : Side: greg: 9mm?
10:47:21 : Side: Glassman823: All glocks are nine mils.
10:47:31 : Side: Madden: No, not all glocks are 9s
10:47:40 : Side: Glassman823: Mod wise yes, IRL, no.
10:47:42 : Side: greg: i think he meant in this game
10:47:52 : Side: Madden: oh... my B
10:48:02 : Side: Glassman823: All good.
10:48:10 : Side: Madden: Who just killed me ?
10:48:34 : Side: greg: suppressor for m4?
10:48:39 : Side: Carniverious: rotex
10:48:42 : Side: greg: i chose the 5.56mm one but
10:48:49 : Side: greg: rotex 5?
10:48:55 : Side: Carniverious: yeah
10:49:12 : Side: greg: its not going on my m4
10:49:16 : Side: greg: could it be b/c of my scope?
10:49:21 : Side: Carniverious: nope
10:49:21 : Side: Glassman823: No
10:49:30 : Side: Glassman823: Might be the mod model of the m4
10:49:33 : Side: Glassman823: I know there are two different ones
10:50:19 : Side: greg: one last question sorry.
10:50:24 : Side: Glassman823: You're good.
10:50:24 : Side: greg: how do i turn on a flashlight on a gun?
10:50:27 : Side: Glassman823: L

10:50:41 : Side: Glassman823: Lazor*
10:50:49 : Side: Madden: Lazer
10:50:50 : Side: greg: idk doesnt seam to illuminate much for me
10:50:53 : Side: Alpacie: optima
10:50:57 : Side: Glassman823: Personally, I highly advise against using a flashlight
10:51:05 : Side: Glassman823: That's just a beacon saying "kill me"
10:51:12 : Side: Alpacie: it doesnt give me a option to use my first aid kits
10:51:20 : Side: Glassman823: You need insta docs
10:51:22 : Side: Glassman823: To heal
10:51:55 : Side: WO2. A.Barton: optima
10:52:00 : Side: WO2. A.Barton: are you afk?

11:02:42 : Side: Lane LeBron: then wtf am i doing wrong for some reason i cant get the wood to elevate
11:04:49 : Side: Lane LeBron: is it because the pgupand down button are being used for a diff movement
