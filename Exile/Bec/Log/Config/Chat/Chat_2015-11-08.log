11:01:44 : Direct: AssassinCult: do you want money
11:01:46 : Side: ChronicleDude: 2 choppers and all the other stuff?
11:02:01 : Side: MCmaddawg: You dont die if you get ran over
11:02:06 : Side: MCmaddawg: Unless that happened outside trader
11:02:08 : Side: Falopa: Doesnt matter now, I will contact an admin and he will deal with it
11:02:37 : Side: trekky: The only way you would've died is if you were outside the trade zone lol. If you had 2 helis parked inside the trade zone and you left for whatever
11:02:40 : Side: trekky: reason you're just plain stupid
11:02:44 : Side: AssassinCult: what deal with me trying to help you
11:02:46 : Side: AssassinCult: great job
11:02:57 : Side: AssassinCult: im saying ill give you stuff
11:03:01 : Side: AssassinCult: then you are refusing it
11:03:10 : Side: Falopa: Well you are offering me a gun
11:03:21 : Side: Falopa: I want my chopper 
11:03:22 : Side: AssassinCult: yes i was goona give you money all that i have
11:03:36 : Side: AssassinCult: then you was refusing that
11:03:40 : Side: Falopa: Well you dont have the money to repay me
11:03:43 : Side: trekky: You left it presumably unlocked and unattended at a trader. Unless he RAN OVER your chopper, he's not at fault.

11:04:12 : Side: MCmaddawg: I smell bullshit

14:16:30 : Side: [aC] mizifih: get rekt!
14:16:31 : Side: Bowman: what? why whats wrong with intel?
14:16:44 : Side: TheHurtShoulder: nothing....just too expensive for me
14:16:44 : Side: Deilesz: Im running a amd fx 9370 with a gtx 660
14:16:46 : Side: bfRIENDLY: went from amd to intel and will never go back

14:17:09 : Side: Noxian: got a 970, runs so good
14:17:13 : Side: TheHurtShoulder: ive had about 3 or 4 AMD cpus and never once had issues
14:17:13 : Side: TorGunnar: same
14:17:16 : Side: Strelok: i find that the best players have the most humble pc's
14:17:19 : Side: Bowman: and isn't going to turn into an 8core lava box
14:17:23 : Side: Articulate: love the 970
14:17:24 : Side: bfRIENDLY: no such thing as "forever" with gaming Pc's lol
14:17:31 : Side: Kraith: i switched from an 8350 to a 4770k and the difference is massivce
14:17:34 : Side: Bowman: ok clearly i'm exaggerating
14:17:42 : Side: Bowman: i love my 4790k
14:17:43 : Side: bfRIENDLY: ;)

14:18:32 : Side: Bowman: I got mine for like $290
14:18:32 : Side: bfRIENDLY: hope you have 24 gigs of mmory to run titax
14:18:34 : Side: Kraith: titans arent even intended for gaming either
14:18:34 : Side: Noxian: 980ti > titan
14:18:37 : Side: Articulate: still runs great
14:18:41 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: so what should i get a 980 ti?
14:18:42 : Side: Bowman: so it wasn't really expensive
14:18:54 : Side: Strelok: i play on a Q6600
14:19:00 : Side: bfRIENDLY: more worth it if your into video rendering and graphic design
14:19:06 : Side: Kraith: oh god the old quadro cards
14:19:06 : Side: Kraith: ew
14:19:10 : Side: Deilesz: wait you need ram to run the cpu and graphics

14:21:53 : Side: Tim: screw black ops man, i used to like it but they got sucky after mw2
14:21:55 : Side: Kraith: i would love to play CoD 4 if i still had my OG copy

14:22:04 : Side: Deilesz: I need mw2 in my life again
14:22:05 : Side: Strelok: buy on steam
14:22:14 : Side: Deilesz: so many hackers
14:22:16 : Side: Kraith: CoD 4 was the birth of modern quick scoping
14:22:17 : Side: Tim: mw2 was the last good one
14:22:21 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: i miss world at war

14:26:43 : Side: d4yz_player: how about DayZ but not the Standalone?!
14:26:48 : Side: TheHurtShoulder: Conkers bad fur day, best game ever!
14:26:48 : Side: gazzy5: lol ratchet and clank deadlocked was great.
14:26:51 : Side: BigRealFish: Nonono Jak and Daxter
14:26:55 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: im pretty sure everyone here played dayz standalone
14:27:00 : Side: Tim: i havent
14:27:02 : Side: Strelok: nope
14:27:05 : Side: Demonic: oh man ratchet and clank was fun
14:27:08 : Side: Strelok: peice of crap broken game 
14:27:10 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: dayz mod*****

14:27:17 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: mod**** not that shity standalone
14:27:18 : Side: Tim: jack and dexter was fun as well
14:27:22 : Side: d4yz_player: no i mean DayZ not the DayZ standalone
14:27:22 : Side: Hsarb: imo mod is better than standalone
14:27:25 : Side: Strelok: 1k hours on mdo
14:27:26 : Side: Strelok: mod
14:27:27 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: ^
14:27:38 : Side: LiTTle NaStY: mod is better at the moment
14:27:43 : Side: Hsarb: yeah agreed
14:27:50 : Side: Tim: i remember playing lara croft on the ps1 or 2
14:27:51 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: it will be for the next 10 years
14:27:55 : Side: Tim: that was the bomb
14:27:55 : Side: Dennis: that was a hard fight at the old mission:D
14:28:01 : Side: LiTTle NaStY: standalone there is to many bugs
14:28:03 : Side: Tim: tits made out of triangles
14:28:08 : Side: Tim: but still a cool game
14:28:10 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: standalone has been in alpha for 3 years
14:28:16 : Side: Demonic: yeah hahah
14:28:24 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: "alpha"
14:28:27 : Side: LiTTle NaStY: yeah and will be for another 3 
14:28:37 : Side: Deilesz: Dayz standalone was the best when it first came out the updates slowly ruined the fps
14:28:39 : Side: Bowman: so what about rust?
14:28:49 : Side: Thunderstruck: that moment when your hovering in your heli, and accidently press esc twice. 
14:28:49 : Side: Tim: never played rust
14:28:54 : Side: Bowman: really?
14:29:02 : Side: BigRealFish: Rust is great
14:29:02 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: i liked the old rust alot better
14:29:05 : Side: BigRealFish: Lots of hackers tho
14:29:07 : Side: Hsarb: i did when it was in its first dev phases
14:29:07 : Side: Bowman: i like it and its definitely makes a lot of progess now
14:29:07 : Side: Thunderstruck: log back in to see your 50k heli crash to the ground
14:29:16 : Side: Hsarb: played it a few times recently but no one wants to play it with me
14:29:29 : Side: BigRealFish: Yeah rust isn't fun to solo, which i why i dont play
14:29:38 : Side: Bowman: I just troll if i'm solo
14:29:39 : Side: Hsarb: and i feel like with everyone building bases in the most random locations and so clustered together kinda ruins it for me
14:29:42 : Side: Deilesz: Anyone wanna party up?
14:30:08 : Side: Articulate: rust is annoying atm with people just onioning their bases with high reinforced walls
14:30:27 : Side: Bowman: true it has some balance issues for sure
14:30:31 : Side: Hsarb: yeah the base building meta is all wrong imo it doesnt click with me
14:31:42 : Side: Deilesz: Where do i aim in the dms scope?
14:31:47 : Side: Collin: fuck you I did n ot run you over neer the trader and you shoot me 
14:31:48 : Side: Hsarb: the dot
14:31:50 : Side: scott: the delta
14:31:50 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: is the titan lock on?
14:31:53 : Side: Bowman: this gets annoying
14:31:55 : Side: Hsarb: really?
14:32:01 : Side: Hsarb: i thught it was zeroed for the dot
14:32:01 : Side: Bowman: whats with the random kicks
14:32:10 : Side: Tim: titan should lock on
14:32:19 : Side: scott: the dot is the 50 above mark
14:32:21 : Side: Deilesz: The delta Im asuming the green triange?
14:32:26 : Side: scott: 50 m that is
14:32:27 : Side: Hsarb: yeah
14:32:31 : Side: scott: yes
14:32:40 : Side: TheHurtShoulder: what the hell? you cant shoot out street lights?
14:32:42 : Side: Deilesz: No matter why I was missing so many shots
14:32:49 : Side: Sam : how do i buy vehicles their is some sort of pin 
14:32:52 : Side: Hsarb: anyone else think there are way too many early access games that arent completed
14:33:10 : Side: Deilesz: Hence the name "Early access
14:33:18 : Side: Demonic: they added apaches ?
14:33:19 : Side: BigRealFish: The only good early access game that I've played is ark
14:33:25 : Side: Demonic: yeahw
14:33:30 : Side: Bowman: and rust
14:33:37 : Side: BigRealFish: yeah rust too
14:33:37 : Side: Hsarb: no i mean they are never fully developed beyond alpha
14:33:47 : Side: TorGunnar: QUUAAAD
14:33:47 : Side: Deilesz: Yep there is alot
14:34:09 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: thats true i havent seen a single early access game progress to full launch besides minecraft
14:34:31 : Side: Bowman: i mean its jsut a title
14:34:42 : Side: Hsarb: i dont think alpha games should be available on steam until developed into beta
14:34:42 : Side: Bowman: some of the games are rather well developed at this point
14:34:45 : Side: scott: ive seen load what rock have you been hiding under?
14:34:55 : Side: TheHurtShoulder: Rust has progressed very well....
14:35:00 : Side: BigRealFish: ^
14:35:07 : Side: Hsarb: yeah it seriously has
14:35:10 : Side: Tim: from what i've seen on yt rust is doing great
14:35:12 : Side: Bowman: i've seen a lot of "completed" games run like shit
14:35:18 : Side: Hsarb: thats the only alpha state game i've seen become fully dev'd
14:35:18 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: in my opinion rust has gotten worse
14:35:19 : Side: TheHurtShoulder: remember when it had zombies?! lol
14:35:32 : Side: Hsarb: zombies were a nice feature imo
14:35:33 : Side: BigRealFish: I remember farming rad wolves for bps
14:35:35 : Side: Bowman: depends on what kind of game you're looking for
14:35:39 : Side: Hsarb: looooooooool
14:35:47 : Side: Bowman: they're constantly changing and adjusting
14:35:51 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: i loved the dev version of rust
14:35:55 : Side: Bowman: and the dev blogs crack me up
14:35:58 : Side: Hsarb: me too
14:35:58 : Side: BigRealFish: i love rusts graphics too
14:36:00 : Side: Kraith: i love the UI and the Graphics rust has
14:36:00 : Side: Demonic: did they just add appaches?
14:36:05 : Side: Bowman: yes
14:36:10 : Side: Demonic: k thx
14:36:11 : Side: Big Dawg: did they remove all vehicles again from the safezone?
14:36:18 : Side: Hsarb: it has such a great community focus and thats such a rare thing to see
14:36:36 : Side: Articulate: vehicles on reset in safezone are auto unlocked
14:36:50 : Side: Bowman: why can't i find any water :(
14:36:50 : Side: Big Dawg: since when
14:37:07 : Side: TheHurtShoulder: maybe you need a geniune water finding stick bowman
14:37:25 : Side: Bowman: oh, you're right forgot that at home
14:37:30 : Direct: Articulate: any preference on code if i can buy one for you
14:37:37 : Side: TheHurtShoulder: lol 
14:37:38 : Side: Bowman: time to take my frustration out on rabbits
14:37:42 : Direct: Sam : just 1234 will do 
14:37:50 : Side: TorGunnar: quaaad
14:38:39 : Side: Big Dawg: since when do vehicles unlock on restart
14:38:54 : Side: Strelok: that was fast
14:39:02 : Side: Strelok: guessing someone missle'd the mission?
14:39:44 : Side: Bowman: sweet didn't know you could chop trees
14:40:00 : Side: Tim: do helis rearm after restart?
14:41:12 : Side: Bowman: 7% thirst rip me
14:41:17 : Side: Tim: rip
14:41:21 : Side: John: can i store a vehicle?
14:41:23 : Side: Tim: we will remember you
14:41:39 : Side: Bowman: bury me with my pet rock

18:22:24 : Side: Sam is Arnold: cause stinger
18:22:34 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: stingers are too cheap
18:22:40 : Side: Sam is Arnold: they made them cheaper
18:22:44 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: makes the choppers pretty much redundant
18:22:49 : Side: Brotha Grimm: well thats lame
18:22:55 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: like everyone has them
18:23:00 : Side: Kraith: nah

18:23:12 : Side: Kraith: i survived fine
18:23:20 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: but it makes flying so risky
18:23:26 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: cause you get hit all the time
18:23:31 : Side: Kraith: then again i am a really good pilot and autorotated about 1km away from where i was hit
18:23:31 : Side: theninja35: I lost my hawk to a Stinger. I landed it but got shot after leaving because my asshole friend wouldn't lock it.
18:25:58 : Side: theninja35: Can AI bleed out?
18:26:11 : Side: Legion: batman can
18:26:22 : Side: theninja35: But can Superman?
