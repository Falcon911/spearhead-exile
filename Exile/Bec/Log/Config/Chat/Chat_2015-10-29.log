22:29:58 : Side: Falcon911: yes you will be able to buy them just need to get them in the mission. Should have some time tomrrow to get it in. It's going to be more expensive tho
22:33:41 : Side: ODDBALL: Cheeky bastard wheres my NVGs

22:51:21 : Vehicle: ODDBALL: Im pretty sure the laser designator in the car is mine
22:51:39 : Vehicle: ODDBALL: If you dont have one you can have but I may aswell take if you both have already
22:51:55 : Side: XxBOSSZOMBIExX: sounds like they are keeping this server for milsim and anding another for exile.

22:53:35 : Side: Ben: go to one and check it out
22:53:51 : Side: Jason Abimbola: its about a long walk for a trader
22:54:06 : Side: Austin: when you open your inventory you can doubleclick items for details and it tells you how much traders sell them for, they buy for half
22:54:23 : Side: Jason Abimbola: ok thank you very much
22:54:43 : Side: Champion: why can i not buy a sports hatchback?

23:02:21 : Side: Goat: Yeah, as in when are you changing everything?
23:02:36 : Side: Falcon911: ahh we still need to get the second server. 
23:02:42 : Side: Falcon911: proba week
23:02:51 : Side: Champion: whats changing?
23:02:54 : Vehicle: ODDBALL: You need to buy the NV scope for the M110
23:03:08 : Side: Leumas: Anymore talks of using TFR/ACRE or is that still up in the air?
23:03:09 : Side: Falcon911: new server = bigger player count 
23:03:13 : Side: Goat: Is there a post on your guys' forums explaining what's going to happen, exactly?
23:03:22 : Side: Falcon911: there will be
23:03:23 : Vehicle: Wyatt: I know lol, I'm going to try out this M2010
23:03:28 : Side: Falcon911: right now it's fluid
23:03:38 : Side: ODDBALL: Need MBTs
23:03:43 : Side: Goat: rgr
23:03:45 : Side: Falcon911: so i dont wanna dip into speculation
23:03:48 : Side: Champion: so wait falcon. same exact server, but raising player cap?
23:04:08 : Side: Goat: No worries, was just trying to gauge how much effort I should put into a base and whatnot.
23:04:16 : Side: Falcon911: exactly server with maybe a 2-4 hour difference on DB stuff. I'm going to try and move the DB over. 
23:04:33 : Side: Champion: but up the player limit?
23:04:42 : Vehicle: ODDBALL: mission is over/players on it
23:04:43 : Side: Falcon911: yes from 50 - 90
23:04:48 : Side: Goat: Have you guys considered adding more mods? Like JSRS?
23:04:51 : Side: Champion: OH MY GOD YES!
23:04:59 : Side: Champion: THATS AWESOME
23:05:08 : Side: ODDBALL: Need tanks
23:05:15 : Side: Falcon911: you can run jsrs on here. The key is the only thing I needed to place. 
23:05:32 : Side: Goat: Oh alright cool. You've placed it?
23:05:36 : Side: Zheky: for real 
23:05:50 : Side: Falcon911: blastcore and the other sound mod.. cant recall what is called
23:06:17 : Side: Goat: The only ones I know of are Dragonfyre and I thought blastcore was just for explosives and lighting.
23:06:41 : Side: Zheky: so jsrs and blastcore are g2g
23:06:44 : Side: Leumas: JSRS is dragonfyre
23:06:49 : Side: Goat: Yeah I know
23:06:50 : Side: Falcon911: yeah if they dont woirk tell me I seem to recall that one of those im missing the key for it
23:07:04 : Side: Zheky: k i will dl them tonight\
23:07:15 : Side: Goat: I'll try it in a sec. I have them both disabled but installed
23:07:26 : Side: Shitty Bill: *me still thinks TFAR would be an awesome optional mod to have*
23:07:28 : Side: Falcon911: try one at a time
23:07:46 : Side: Falcon911: yeah TFAR would be nive but I'm not going to Force everyone. 
23:07:52 : Side: Falcon911: to our Teamspeak
23:07:54 : Side: MuertoGonzo: what is it?
23:07:57 : Side: Goat: what's player count like right now?
23:07:57 : Side: Champion: ehhhh. tfr means no ts comms. i get it, but ehhh
23:08:01 : Side: Shitty Bill: it wouldnt be required
23:08:07 : Side: Falcon911:  now is 51
23:08:13 : Side: Goat: alright brb
23:08:22 : Side: Falcon911: we avg 52 per day
23:08:22 : Side: Zheky: anyway we could get the rhs clothing back
23:08:27 : Side: Falcon911: sorry hour
23:08:34 : Side: Leumas: You could set it to have it not required on the server. Dodds was talking about if you guys added it that it would be required though
23:08:50 : Side: Falcon911: yeah... im not going to run it
23:09:13 : Side: Falcon911: its a bitch ight now for you all to pay toughter. 
23:09:19 : Side: Falcon911: *play
23:09:37 : Side: Falcon911: now add in the TFAR.. jesus
23:09:46 : Side: MuertoGonzo: what is tfar?
23:09:55 : Side: Falcon911: task force radio
23:09:59 : Side: Shitty Bill: any idea why the group function doesnt show group mate's hexes?
23:10:06 : Side: Champion: it is talking through teamspeak to people in arma
23:10:19 : Side: Falcon911: hardcore is on no group icons
23:10:25 : Side: Champion: it mutes everyone in ts. but then once you are close to someone in arma, it unmutes them
23:10:27 : Side: Shitty Bill: ah
23:10:33 : Side: Leumas: It also adds realistic radios
23:10:41 : Side: Shitty Bill: any chance we could ge the hex? :D
23:10:43 : Side: Champion: so its really really nice voice coms, and yes radios too
23:10:46 : Side: Leumas: With ranges and stuff. Ability to whisper to people, different channels
23:10:47 : Side: Leumas: etc
23:11:03 : Side: Shitty Bill: yeah tfar is awwesome
23:11:05 : Side: Champion: but then, with tfr, you cannot communicate to your team in say another ts
23:11:10 : Side: Falcon911: ? hex.. oh the icons?
23:11:13 : Side: MATEO: ADMIN
23:11:22 : Side: Falcon911: ?
23:11:23 : Side: Shitty Bill: yeah the icons u see on people when your grouped
23:11:34 : Side: Champion: ^
23:11:36 : Side: Champion: please yes
23:11:39 : Side: MATEO: MY IFRIT IS STUCKED
23:11:40 : Side: Falcon911: yeah not sure where exactly Exile has the damn thing on at
23:11:42 : Side: Sirdavidi: hexs would be great
23:11:52 : Side: MATEO: can u tp here?
23:12:04 : Side: Champion: oh wait. so falcon. you didnt disable the hexes?
23:12:31 : Side: Conor: Hexes are being rolled out next Exile update which is aprox. next Thurs.
23:12:51 : Side: Shitty Bill: Conor, they're already rolled out.... they exist on other exile servers
23:12:52 : Side: Champion: hexes for grouped players is sooo nice
23:13:02 : Side: Champion: i would die of happiness if that was in here
23:13:14 : Side: Falcon911: sure
23:13:26 : Side: Falcon911: bingo
23:14:07 : Side: Champion: so falcon do you know how to re enable hexs?
23:14:21 : Side: Falcon911: to my vets here...has the trader camping been decreasing?
23:14:35 : Side: Conor: You're right. They are just adding it to the actual map. Also have team members distance + toggable names
23:14:42 : Side: Shitty Bill: yeah, I havent been camping them as much ;p
23:14:43 : Side: Goat: Alright, dragonfyre works, blastcore does not. When I enabled blastcore I was kicked.
23:14:55 : Side: Falcon911: ok it need the key then
23:15:05 : Side: Shitty Bill: Conor, that'd be rad
23:15:40 : Side: Falcon911: hardcore disable the hexes..no im not comming out of hardcore for that sir
23:16:03 : Side: Champion: whats hardcore do vs. regular
23:16:08 : Side: Champion: disable 3p too?
23:16:12 : Side: Shitty Bill: cant you customize hardcore settings?
23:16:15 : Side: Falcon911: yeap
23:16:19 : Side: Jason Abimbola: when is the sun gonna come up?
23:16:27 : Side: Shitty Bill: jason, ~20 mins
23:16:28 : Side: Goat: I'm only here because play without 3rd person is way better.
23:16:29 : Side: Armadildo: falcon
23:16:30 : Side: Shitty Bill: ingame
23:16:31 : Side: Champion: yeah thats weird that you cannot customize hardcore settings to allow for hex
23:16:32 : Side: Jason Abimbola: ty
23:16:38 : Side: Falcon911: does nto se it seems to be in the client side vs server.. at least I ant find it yet
23:16:40 : Side: Armadildo: disable the radar in the apache, its rediculously op
23:16:54 : Side: Gunnbjofur: Remove kebab
23:17:09 : Side: Goat: If they disable radar they should remove Laser Designators as well.
23:17:15 : Side: Goat: People only use them for thermal
23:17:45 : Side: Icecub: /
23:17:59 : Side: DontTreadOnMe: Do we get donator perks if we donate to the server?
23:18:13 : Side: DontTreadOnMe: like some spare poptabs or something
23:18:24 : Side: Champion: thats against bi tos
23:18:27 : Side: Sirdavidi: I hope not
23:18:33 : Side: Collin: i would quit this server if so
23:18:42 : Side: Collin: thats bull
23:18:54 : Side: Bogus: whoever just stole that UAV is a cunt

23:19:10 : Side: Collin: none of that arma 2 shit 
23:19:14 : Side: Collin: want to buy a uav
23:19:16 : Side: DontTreadOnMe: say a dollar for 500 poptabs
23:19:31 : Side: Collin: 2500
23:19:31 : Side: Zheky: thats a big no no with BI
23:19:48 : Side: Goat: Or go do missions? :) you get 500 tabs for killing 1 npc.
23:19:51 : Side: Collin: in air right now i think
