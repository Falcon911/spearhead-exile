01:19:53 : Side: Viking: Roenne trader
01:20:02 : Side: Wolfy: They can't access their inventory to eat/drink
01:20:08 : Side: Magnum: no we killed him in Roenne City and then we went to the town to sell it and viking like a bitch ran up and locked me in it
01:20:10 : Side: Pickle: Viking is Lieing FYI. We killed him

01:20:47 : Side: Magnum: still, we kill your butt buddy and you broke rules and locked us in at trader
01:20:47 : Side: AvidNinja: well doesnt really matter which one we killed we stole vehicle fair
01:20:48 : Side: Pickle: Well whoever it was your dumb for not locking it when you were getting shot at
01:20:53 : Side: Viking: broke the rules?
01:21:02 : Side: CrouchingPanda: your locked in so you cant get out...
01:21:04 : Side: Wolfy: If it wasn't in the trader it's not against the riles
01:21:09 : Side: Wolfy: You're*
01:21:13 : Side: Viking: show me where it says that.
01:21:22 : Side: Kojak: we know its not against the rules
01:21:25 : Side: Magnum: yeah thats a pretty shit move locking us in after we earned vehicle fair and square
01:21:26 : Side: CrouchingPanda: you cant get out?
01:21:31 : Side: Wolfy: The rules only say it's against the rules to steal in trader
01:21:38 : Side: Kojak: yep
01:21:38 : Side: Magnum: you just cant handle losing a firefight and your vic
01:21:41 : Side: Wolfy: Otherwise it's fair game
01:21:43 : Side: CrouchingPanda: nah we keeping our property
01:21:46 : Side: Magnum: so you had to do bullshit moves
01:21:57 : Side: Viking: Hey man die in my truck I don't care
01:22:04 : Side: Wolfy: To be honest, viking isn't breaking any rules either
01:22:05 : Side: AvidNinja: nah if we dont get vehicle we blow up vehicle
01:22:08 : Side: Viking: Or come back and give it to me
01:22:12 : Side: Viking: Oh no
01:22:13 : Side: Kojak: haha do it
01:22:19 : Side: Viking: lol
01:22:19 : Side: AvidNinja: nah we blow up vehicle
01:22:23 : Side: CrouchingPanda: we can by another one
01:22:23 : Side: Wolfy: They can just log out and log in
01:22:27 : Side: Wolfy: And destroy it
01:22:27 : Side: Magnum: if you didn't care then why paradrop on trader and lock me in as fast as you could
01:22:29 : Side: Kojak: yep
01:22:36 : Side: CrouchingPanda: he was already there
01:22:39 : Side: Viking: I spawned in here 
01:22:47 : Side: Wolfy: I thought you didn't die Viking?
01:22:53 : Side: Kojak: he didnt
01:22:54 : Side: Wolfy: How would you have spawned in?
01:22:55 : Side: CrouchingPanda: yeah he didnt
01:23:07 : Side: Wolfy: What vehicle is it?
01:23:10 : Side: CrouchingPanda: from spawning in yesterday
01:23:12 : Side: Kojak: 5 ton
01:23:18 : Side: AvidNinja: that a weight
01:23:20 : Side: Wolfy: What's it worth?
01:23:21 : Side: Viking: I haven't been on since yesterday
01:23:22 : Side: AvidNinja: not a vic
01:23:23 : Side: CrouchingPanda: he logged out there
01:23:28 : Side: Kojak: 8500, so not much haha
01:23:34 : Side: AvidNinja: so didnt spawn logged
01:23:41 : Side: Wolfy: So you get 4250 for selling it
01:23:49 : Side: Kojak: yeah but they cant
01:23:50 : Side: Pickle: Still money is money
01:23:57 : Side: Wolfy: Here's my suggestion, I gift you guys that money, and you give him his car back
01:24:00 : Side: Wolfy: Sound fair?
01:24:04 : Side: Viking: tell you what, someone wires me 4250 I'll unlock it for you
01:24:22 : Side: Pickle: Pfft we would have more fun blowing it up
01:24:33 : Side: AvidNinja: heh
01:24:37 : Side: Wolfy: You're being difficult about 4250?
01:24:44 : Side: Jason Abimbola: and it'd be cheaper
01:24:44 : Side: Wolfy: Just to prove a point?
01:24:44 : Side: Jason Abimbola: lel
01:24:53 : Side: CrouchingPanda: they are just salty
01:24:56 : Side: Pickle: Yeah Imma be that way i have 4 pop caps 
01:25:16 : Side: Wolfy: And you don't want 4k?
01:25:28 : Side: Wolfy: What gun do you have?
01:25:36 : Side: Pickle: A MX
01:25:48 : Side: Wolfy: You're not going to blow it up with a 6.5
01:25:56 : Side: Wolfy: Even a 50 cal would struggle
01:25:57 : Side: Pickle: so either we can get an admin involved and have it
01:26:12 : Side: Kojak: lol why would the admin care?
01:26:13 : Side: Pickle: or we can do what we wish to it
01:26:19 : Side: Kojak: haha blow it up
01:26:20 : Side: Wolfy: If I were you, I'd take the 4k
01:26:21 : Side: Viking: go get an admin involved
01:26:28 : Side: Viking: You will lose this
01:26:37 : Side: Pickle: Alright blow it up it is
01:26:41 : Side: Wolfy: The admin wont care, nobody is in the wrong.
01:26:43 : Side: Kojak: haha alright
01:26:56 : Side: Wolfy: Wow. These guys. They don't want 4k.
01:26:59 : Side: Wolfy: Alright.

01:28:11 : Side: Wolfy: You literally have NO bargaining power.

01:37:12 : Side: Dackle2142: why is the viper 50k ?
01:37:32 : Side: Falopa: Because it has 70 hydras
01:37:33 : Side: Wolfy: Because it's really strong
01:37:37 : Side: Wolfy: And heat seekers
01:38:35 : Direct: Wolfy: Just a heads up

01:38:50 : Direct: Wolfy: I know
01:38:54 : Direct: CrouchingPanda: ok thx for the heads up
01:38:56 : Direct: Wolfy: So keep it safe alright?
01:39:02 : Direct: CrouchingPanda: this som bs
01:39:20 : Direct: Wolfy: However, it will stop anything short of a 50 cal
01:39:34 : Direct: Wolfy: And additionally it has night vision on the gunner
01:39:43 : Direct: Wolfy: Press + on the keypad
01:39:57 : Side: Jason Abimbola: can you run into a safezone to escape a fight
01:39:58 : Side: Jason Abimbola: ?
01:40:01 : Direct: Wolfy: You can also "turn out" for better visibility
01:40:14 : Direct: Wolfy: It's a scout APC
01:40:23 : Direct: Wolfy: It also has a flare launcher at the back
01:40:51 : Direct: Wolfy: Not amphibious, but can traverse deep water due to the snorkel
01:41:08 : Direct: Wolfy: It's not bad, better than the BTR IMO
01:41:17 : Direct: Wolfy: Just be careful with it
01:41:24 : Direct: Wolfy: If you lose a track it's gone
01:41:28 : Direct: Wolfy: You can't repair it
01:41:34 : Direct: Wolfy: But it's super good on fuel
01:41:40 : Direct: Wolfy: I'm off
01:41:43 : Direct: Wolfy: Take care

06:01:34 : Direct: Vexus: access inside here and all my codes worked because I spent a long time
06:02:08 : Direct: Vexus: going through and finding all the codes, but then I got a weapon to break
06:03:08 : Direct: Vexus: into the outside wall which is open now because it took enough damage, including a satchel
06:03:50 : Direct: Vexus: so this building was broken and wasnt even here
06:04:11 : Direct: Vexus: i didnt even know there was a building here at the time due to the 
06:04:21 : Direct: Vexus: restart I was trapped inside this building

07:34:32 : Side: Rusty: seems like a reasonable expenditure
07:34:47 : Side: AvengedCanadian: i would rather spend that money on a cobra
07:34:52 : Side: AvengedCanadian: and terrorize the server
07:35:06 : Side: Rusty: how canadian of you
07:35:12 : Side: AvengedCanadian: haha
07:35:34 : Side: Austin: or ill buy 20 or so atvs and leave them all in the same feild of tall grass

07:35:52 : Side: AvengedCanadian: nawww
07:35:54 : Side: Rusty: that's the idea
07:36:10 : Side: Austin: cheaper than setting up slams lol
07:36:14 : Side: AvengedCanadian: its more fun to kill people and make them angry as hell
07:37:25 : Side: Ofc. J. Argent [439]: who did i kill at the mission?
07:37:59 : Side: AvengedCanadian: george lucas
07:38:06 : Side: Ofc. J. Argent [439]: good

07:40:51 : Side: Liam: 5k
07:41:13 : Side: AvengedCanadian: well if something is seriously bad you should call an ambulance and go to the er
07:41:48 : Side: Austin: you know what I mean, eg. cancer
07:42:21 : Side: Austin: or if you think it was hard to get a transplant in the states, oh boy
07:42:46 : Side: AvengedCanadian: its just about as equal
07:42:56 : Side: AvengedCanadian: if not a tiny bit harder
07:43:03 : Side: Rusty: "it's just about as equal" may be my favorite new thing ever said
07:43:07 : Side: Tim: did someone put a mine on the main road from trader?
07:43:18 : Side: Rusty: hopefully
