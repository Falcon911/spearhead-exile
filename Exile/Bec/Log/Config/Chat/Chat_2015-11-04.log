10:36:40 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: I hope i wont get killed again at not even 500m from safezone.... for the third time
10:44:05 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: alright everybody lets not shoot within 1km from safe zones and follow the rules.....
10:45:28 : Side: KFC: Never flip a bike next to a car...
10:45:45 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: hell no

10:46:16 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: hey harisson lets not shoot within 1km from safe zones please ?
10:46:36 : Side: Harrison: we were 800m out and the rule is 500m
10:46:36 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: even panic shooting like you said
10:46:45 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: no look at the rules its 1km
10:46:51 : Side: Alexander: No its 1km
10:46:53 : Side: Harrison: i didn't see you were unarmed or i wouldnt have shot
10:47:08 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: i fucking warned you before i entered
10:47:10 : Side: Harrison: i eard optima say 500m once
10:47:19 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: now its 1km
10:47:20 : Side: Freeman: its 1km
10:47:26 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: it used to be 500m
10:47:30 : Side: Harrison: okay sorry
10:47:34 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: but its not anymore
10:47:43 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: and that area isnt at 800m at all
10:48:15 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: its at 200m from the end of the safezone
10:49:23 : Side: Harrison: it is 600 from the trader
10:49:45 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: 200 from end of safezone and thats what its counted from im pretty sure
10:50:11 : Side: KFC: its counted from the end of it
10:50:17 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: yup
10:50:28 : Side: Harrison: oh well sorry
10:50:28 : Side: KFC: and its 1000m
10:50:30 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: like i said so it was at 200 m
10:50:38 : Side: Harrison: you din't lose any good gear anyway
10:51:11 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: well i came back cause i fucker killed me there like 5 mins before
10:51:22 : Side: Harrison: hahahaha
10:51:39 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: and he got a warning from optima
10:51:42 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: so you are lucky
10:52:28 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: i think the rule should say gun holstered within 1km from safezones
10:52:49 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: and they should make a circle on the map 
10:52:57 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: for the 1km limit
10:53:35 : Side: Harrison: a notification would be nice
10:54:02 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: yeah at least
10:54:19 : Side: Pvt. Brian McMillan: but it would be even easier with a circle on map

11:12:50 : Side: Austin: and over half the time it won't even be from players
11:13:07 : Side: Plisken: i had almost given up on playing arma because everything is 3rd person gayness now
11:14:04 : Side: SEBBES: yeah this server is awesome, but it has been low on players the last week or so
11:14:22 : Side: KFC: not rly
11:14:23 : Side: Scout: they removed it from a3launcher
11:14:28 : Side: SEBBES: why?
11:14:29 : Side: Scout: thats mainly why

11:15:09 : Side: SEBBES: why remove it from a3 launcher?
11:15:27 : Side: Austin: too many people who ask too many stupid questions

11:16:02 : Side: Krazy: someone shooting someone?
11:16:31 : Side: Austin: what was a stupid question? all I said is thats the reason I am sure, the server was getting overpopulated with noobs

11:18:17 : Side: Plisken: my fps is garbage even with shadows off completely
11:19:10 : Side: Austin: its the map, its huge, the vehicle count is rediculous and these missions they have now after the server update yesterday are killing mine
11:19:20 : Side: SEBBES: yeah same here
11:19:33 : Side: SEBBES: and i guess roaming ai helis dosent help fps to much :P
11:20:00 : Side: Austin: but this heli patrol keeps passing my base all the time and I have a hmg to shoot at em :P
11:20:20 : Side: Austin: have only used half of one of my 500 round mags

14:33:25 : Side: Optima: but vics are fixed lol :D
14:33:32 : Side: Yannick: they added roaming AI so fps is horrbile
14:33:44 : Side: Lugie: Cool though
14:33:45 : Side: Ur mom: what are those squares on the map?
14:34:06 : Side: Lugie: Anyone have a base at christansoe?
14:34:08 : Side: TheTW: Optima it is not so nice that AI spawns in my base :/ 
14:34:11 : Side: Ur mom: wait is the roaming ai everywhere?
14:34:15 : Side: FamishedBurrito: the red diamonds are death
14:34:29 : Side: FamishedBurrito: yeah AI even end up intrader areas and destroy vehicles
14:34:40 : Side: Ur mom: can we kill ai in traders
14:34:47 : Side: wolf: yeah
14:34:56 : Side: Lugie: I loike it
14:34:59 : Side: Lugie: adds some atmosphere
14:35:01 : Side: TheTW: otherwise they will kill u i guess xD
14:35:04 : Side: Lugie: welp
14:35:07 : Side: Lugie: time to get moving
14:35:09 : Side: FamishedBurrito: AI cant kill you in trader zones
14:35:14 : Side: Lugie: ill leave me fire burning for anyone else
14:35:22 : Side: FamishedBurrito: but they can kill you within 1km of them
14:35:42 : Side: Ur mom: so basically getting down to traders on foot is impossible?
14:35:44 : Side: FamishedBurrito: so theres gonna be more excuses flying around as to why people kill within 1km of trader zones
14:36:05 : Side: Peanut_Butt: more or less
14:36:08 : Side: FamishedBurrito: reminds me so much of the overpoch server
14:36:17 : Side: Ur mom: are these wandering Ai EVERYWHERE on the map?
14:36:20 : Side: Ur mom: Like everywhere?
14:36:24 : Side: FamishedBurrito: they spawn in
14:36:27 : Side: Lugie: just the red markers
14:36:27 : Side: FamishedBurrito: can be anywhere
14:36:40 : Side: FamishedBurrito: no the red markers dont signify the roaming AI
14:36:43 : Side: Ur mom: so like at the bandit pose?
14:36:48 : Side: FamishedBurrito: im pretty sure at least
14:36:58 : Side: Yannick: red markers are roaming ai choppers
14:37:03 : Side: FamishedBurrito: i had 10 at my base last night
14:37:06 : Side: MCmaddawg: Yeah
14:37:07 : Side: FamishedBurrito: no red marker
14:37:12 : Side: MCmaddawg: And those AI choppers are deadly as fuck
14:37:13 : Side: Ur mom: how do we know where th romaing ai spawn?
14:37:15 : Side: Lugie: ah, screw bases
14:37:19 : Side: Lugie: im always on the run

14:37:24 : Side: Lugie: maybe a campfire here and there
14:37:32 : Side: Yannick: they will fuck you when you dont know XD
14:37:34 : Side: MoeLestor: nothing is spawning in :O
14:38:10 : Side: FamishedBurrito: from what ive seen, the AI try to kill eachother more often than killing you
14:39:39 : Side: Ur mom: whats the thing on the map that says free gas lmao
14:39:49 : Side: Demonic: its free gas..............
14:39:57 : Side: Lugie: ive just arrived at auschwitz
14:39:59 : Side: Ur mom: In the middle of an ocean?
14:40:01 : Side: Lugie: great fuckin region name
14:40:18 : Side: Ur mom: what about the red roene marker and the blue roen havn marker?
14:40:24 : Side: Zheky: report it with the cords
14:41:10 : Side: Optima: issue with the AIs, is that they run away, FAR away from the mission area
14:41:22 : Side: [MSS] Relaxo: and spawn in bases...
14:41:27 : Side: FamishedBurrito: how good is the M320 LRR??
14:41:31 : Side: MCmaddawg: Those choppers man, OP as fuck
14:42:15 : Side: FamishedBurrito: also how do i get this mission failure off my screen... it wont go away
14:42:37 : Side: Krazy: ^
14:43:01 : Side: Ur mom: so what are those blue boat markers in roenne and hammer?
14:43:19 : Side: Warboy: whats up with random cease fire stuff
14:43:35 : Side: Lugie: cause people in the same squad keep shooting eachother

14:55:33 : Side: MCmaddawg: Optima, does an airfield count as a military base?
14:55:56 : Direct: Shatte: yea, doesnt matter
14:56:14 : Side: FamishedBurrito: the answer seems pretty obvious
14:56:38 : Side: MCmaddawg: Have you never seen civilian airports?
14:56:41 : Direct: Shatte: i was middle of a field and still noone spotted me
14:56:44 : Side: MCmaddawg: Depends on who you ask.
14:56:48 : Direct: Shatte: and there was like 10ppl ?
14:56:55 : Side: FamishedBurrito: leeroy jenkins is trying so hard to cheat on this server.. thats attemp 3 i think?

14:57:44 : Side: FamishedBurrito: ATC tower
14:57:46 : Side: MCmaddawg: Seems like a private airport
14:57:50 : Side: FamishedBurrito: and military hangars
14:58:04 : Side: FamishedBurrito: it spawns military loot
14:58:08 : Side: FamishedBurrito: and you cannot build on it
14:58:11 : Side: MCmaddawg: Everything spawns military loot
14:58:18 : Side: Ur mom: no lmao 
14:58:22 : Side: FamishedBurrito: not true lol

15:12:19 : Side: MoeLestor: can anyone confirm how much money you get for killing an AI at a mission?
15:12:28 : Side: MrOffline: nada
15:12:34 : Side: MoeLestor: :/
15:12:45 : Side: Yannick: it depends on the mission
15:12:51 : Side: Dhaniel Thalford: I got 500 per once
15:13:00 : Side: Dhaniel Thalford: I think range also affects it
15:13:14 : Side: MoeLestor: i mean caps not respect points or what its called
15:13:26 : Side: Dhaniel Thalford: Yea caps
15:13:46 : Side: MrOffline: you don't get toptaps anymore on killing AI
15:13:54 : Side: Dhaniel Thalford: I did yesterday...
15:13:56 : Side: FamishedBurrito: i do?
15:13:57 : Side: MrOffline: poptaps*
15:14:24 : Side: Douwe: where to find wells?
15:14:31 : Side: Dhaniel Thalford: Trader
15:14:48 : Side: Douwe: there are no wells in towns or anything?
15:15:00 : Side: Dhaniel Thalford: Not that can refill your bottles
15:15:08 : Side: Douwe: alright, thanks
15:15:35 : Side: BoneS: Whos is the tiger striped hummingbird?
15:16:27 : Side: MoeLestor: really few weapon loots in houses
15:17:07 : Side: Krazy: u guys r little bitches to cry to admins xdddddd cant even quikscope
15:17:44 : Side: Dhaniel Thalford: Bravo, you've spoke your first sentance XD
15:17:51 : Side: MoeLestor: !uptime
15:18:31 : Side: Douwe: only thing i dislike from this mod is how hard it is to stay hydrated
15:18:43 : Side: Dhaniel Thalford: Yea, it is pretty bad
15:18:47 : Side: Shatte: lol?
15:19:07 : Side: MCmaddawg: I usually end up carrying 12 water bottles
15:19:09 : Side: Dhaniel Thalford: Not hard, but you get dehydrated fast
15:19:11 : Side: MCmaddawg: So I think it's alright
15:19:37 : Side: Douwe: i found 1 full bottle and im at 13% thirst
15:20:07 : Side: Yannick: lucky haha 
15:20:56 : Side: MoeLestor: guess there is no caps on AI drop
15:23:39 : Side: theninja35: Won't the new mission system drive people away from each other and reduce combat?
15:23:54 : Side: MCmaddawg: why would it?
15:24:13 : Side: theninja35: Because the missions are not really missions. They are up-all-restart loot objectives.
15:24:40 : Side: theninja35: Plus, many seem to lose FPS from it.
15:24:41 : Side: MCmaddawg: So how does that affect what you just mentioned earlier?
15:25:02 : Side: theninja35: Because you can run in and leave. There is no temporary but intense combat.
15:25:02 : Side: NightStalker: do towns spawn trucks/cars?
15:25:04 : Side: Noleski: my fps is better
15:25:05 : Side: Yannick: so do flares actually work or no? 
15:25:20 : Side: MCmaddawg: Actually, missions do end when you clear them out
15:25:23 : Side: Noleski: yes
15:25:44 : Side: Yannick: the starter pistol flares
15:26:51 : Vehicle: wolf: PRESS 5
15:28:14 : Side: Yannick: what do the signal cylanders do? the ones that go in the starter pistol
15:28:23 : Side: Jozef : not shit
15:28:53 : Side: Yannick: really? XD damn cuz i found a starter pistol on the ground and wanted to shoot flares but i guess i cant 
15:29:03 : Side: Jozef : I was disappointed to
15:29:07 : Side: Jozef : is it in the trader?
15:29:22 : Side: Yannick: i found the starter pistol in a garage 
15:29:33 : Side: Jozef : oh nbm apperantly it works outsdie the trader try hooting it in airw
15:29:44 : Side: Yannick: oh it works outside?
15:30:02 : Side: Jozef : try muka luka

17:46:48 : Side: theninja35: Why would they? They're not OP.
17:47:01 : Side: theninja35: You have to take them off and pull up your regular gun, giving them time to move.
17:47:25 : Side: Brajuh90: still, makes it impossible to effectivly hide
17:47:26 : Side: ODDBALL: Should have had both of you!
