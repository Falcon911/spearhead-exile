04:07:38 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: or rollback
04:07:38 : Side: Liam: i dont see a point in even going to missions then if you get shit all from it
04:07:47 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: yup
04:07:52 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: dont even bother
04:07:57 : Side: Liam: yea jxr but thats only if you do it the boring way
04:07:57 : Side: JXR: Fill an offroad with loot and got 14.5k
04:08:01 : Side: JXR: gg
04:08:02 : Side: JXR: Yea
04:08:05 : Side: JXR: just started
04:08:12 : Side: JXR: So needed something to boost me
04:08:13 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: still no point/
04:08:14 : Side: Freeman: first off the had to re-roll, second they have not ruined anything its just a bit harder to get money unless you loot.. 
04:08:15 : Side: Liam: it was much funner to kill ai and do missions fo rit
04:08:28 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: selling is the best money making
04:08:40 : Side: Liam: but thats boring
04:08:50 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: /exactly
04:09:10 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: i got money i dont even know what to do with it
04:09:28 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: i wanted to go kill people and go on a misssion
04:09:33 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: but all u see is AI
04:09:41 : Side: Liam: and now theres gona be alot less action at missions because no one gets anything from them so they wont go
04:10:07 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: make money till they change to something else
04:14:22 : Side: Brodsort117: Does there have to be roaming ai in every city possible......
04:15:09 : Side: Liam: theres roaming ai in citys?
04:15:22 : Side: Liam: whats that hasla thing on the map about?
04:16:08 : Side: Brodsort117: Hasle is getting raided by npc's
04:16:25 : Side: Liam: ah
04:16:32 : Side: Liam: thats pretty cool
04:16:39 : Side: Brodsort117: and When I was on yesterday, a city I was in was invaded by ai unannounced
04:16:52 : Side: Liam: but itd be nice if i had a reason to kill them
04:17:07 : Side: Brodsort117: Completely eliminating the "Loot" runs...
04:17:32 : Side: Liam: ?
04:20:40 : Side: Joseph: great roaming ai are in aircraft now too
04:20:55 : Side: Liam: yea the red boxes on map
04:21:48 : Side: Brodsort117: Think the addition of roaming ai was a bit overkill. Specially for newcombers that are still trying to get used to the game
04:22:13 : Side: Joseph: This isnt exactly a server for newcombers though
04:22:22 : Side: Joseph: thats why its a hardcore server
04:22:26 : Side: MCmaddawg: The romaing AI isnt the toughest thing around.
04:22:34 : Side: MCmaddawg: It's the roaming AI helos
04:22:51 : Side: Liam: i like that theres roaming ai i just wish i had a reason to kill them
04:22:53 : Side: Brodsort117: Friend of mine started me on this and I have the most progress on this. But, ai completely makes me fail
04:23:18 : Side: Joseph: \
04:23:32 : Side: Liam: i mean now that theres alot more ai maybe 500 is a bit steep but only 12 is just horrible maybe 250 would be good
04:25:03 : Side: Joseph: i wish they left the mission level guide on the bottom left of the map
04:25:35 : Side: Liam: when did they make all these changes
04:25:48 : Side: Brodsort117: Very recently....
04:25:52 : Side: Joseph: im guessing when the server was off of Arma3Launcher
04:26:08 : Side: Joseph: i havent been able to get on for about a week 
04:26:20 : Side: MCmaddawg: Search thru the ingame server browser
04:26:37 : Side: Joseph: yeah but then i have to find all the mods and enable them
04:26:42 : Side: Brodsort117: It was still on the in game server browser if you loaded all the right mods up and looked under recent
04:26:49 : Side: MCmaddawg: Six mods you need to enable
04:27:01 : Side: Brodsort117: easy ones to remember too 
04:27:06 : Side: MCmaddawg: Yep
04:27:15 : Side: MCmaddawg: Then just remote the server and bam, you're in
04:27:36 : Side: Liam: if you use arma 3 sync and then and the join server option click the blank one and then itll start up arma with all mods enabled and menu then just
04:27:39 : Side: BackDoorBandit: recent join tab?
04:27:39 : Side: Liam: remote connect
04:28:52 : Side: BackDoorBandit: lies!!! i havent been destroy!!!
04:31:10 : Side: MCmaddawg: god, I wish they made mouses compatible with rings lol
04:31:40 : Side: Freeman: you should not put them in your ring...
04:32:12 : Side: MCmaddawg: Im saying it's uncomfortable to play when you're wearing a ring
04:34:42 : Side: Brodsort117: So im guessing its impossible to lonewolf now.. 
04:34:51 : Side: MCmaddawg: It's possible
04:34:53 : Side: MCmaddawg: It always is
04:34:56 : Side: Liam: town raid?
04:35:27 : Side: MCmaddawg: Just beware of groups of three or more
04:35:32 : Side: Brodsort117: How when you get overrun in the middle of trying to make money off of loot
04:35:34 : Side: MCmaddawg: There's always that one dude that gets away
04:35:47 : Side: MCmaddawg: Dont go to loot unless you're sure you're alone
04:35:51 : Side: MCmaddawg: Or you dont give a shit
04:36:19 : Side: Brodsort117: Well, when theres no ai, theres players who shoot on sight
04:36:36 : Side: MCmaddawg: It all comes down how aware you are
04:36:40 : Side: MCmaddawg: to how*
04:38:05 : Side: BackDoorBandit: i like to watch people fight xD
04:38:36 : Side: BackDoorBandit: sometime i got too close and became the target though ;(
04:40:28 : Side: Liam: whats the captive marker about?
04:40:39 : Side: MCmaddawg: it's a mission
04:40:56 : Side: Liam: do you have to free them or somthign?
04:41:00 : Side: MCmaddawg: Yes
04:46:46 : Side: MCmaddawg: So who was shooting at AI choppers just now?
04:56:14 : Side: Liam: ok nukes really?
05:00:45 : Side: Stormz: i thought they fixed the missing vehicle glitch?
05:01:14 : Side: Freeman: it is fixed
05:01:57 : Side: Stormz: doubt it because i've lost another helo to it
05:02:11 : Side: Freeman: its glitched and blown then
05:02:21 : Side: Stormz: and yet again i'm in the middle of nowhere and all my magazines are gone.
05:02:27 : Side: Freeman: because its not the server ;)
05:02:53 : Side: Stormz: i'm aware but it's still very aggravating
05:03:05 : Side: Freeman: arma3 blues :(
05:03:11 : Side: KFC: Any1 has an axe?
05:04:09 : Side: Liam: so theres nothing for killing ai now?
05:04:15 : Side: KFC: yep
05:04:22 : Side: KFC: it kills the purpose of missions tbh
05:04:27 : Side: Liam: well aint that a bitch
05:11:13 : Side: Liam: eh big problem

05:17:50 : Side: Stormz: new mission system seems pretty dumb
05:18:12 : Side: Liam: so i just killed like 20 ai for nothing?
05:18:24 : Side: Liam: balls of course i die when i type
05:18:24 : Side: Stormz: no idea

05:32:21 : Side: Merczy: what are the red scared with the tilted hour galss inside?
05:36:49 : Side: Merczy: when does the server usually pick up?

21:41:01 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: pretty useless though
21:41:08 : Side: Jason Abimbola: yea
21:41:14 : Side: Jason Abimbola: unless you've got a base
21:41:16 : Side: Yannick: the only bad thing is that its fucking bright XD 
21:41:16 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: cause you'll be stuck with the broken vehicle
21:41:22 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: not the repair truck
21:41:36 : Side: Jason Abimbola: unless you're in a convoy or something
21:41:46 : Side: Austin: you could use it if you downed an AI heli to fix it
21:41:52 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: where is the missioan???
21:41:54 : Side: Jason Abimbola: that too
21:41:54 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: yeah

21:42:24 : Side: Sir TomaDoh: no mission?
21:42:25 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: and if you can afford the rocket to down the heli im sure you can afford duct tape
21:42:29 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: not atm
21:42:36 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: changing them back to old style
21:42:37 : Side: Yannick: its funny how duct tape can repair anything haha 
21:42:44 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: its realistic
21:42:48 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: duct tape op

21:45:10 : Side: Bogus: depends on size of base
21:45:16 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: lets say 30m
21:45:27 : Side: Bogus: depends on how many walls
21:45:28 : Side: Bogus: and stuff
21:45:44 : Side: ThaQtipWilson: how much is yours
21:45:53 : Side: Bogus: roughly 10k respect

22:36:06 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: plot twist: his computer is a potato
22:36:27 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: it renders only potatoes
22:36:49 : Side: Hank Scudder: And because it's Arma 3, they're poorly optimized potatoes.
22:37:40 : Side: Mr. Rager: I see Xd

23:20:57 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: xD
23:22:23 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: anyone fancy letting me try and raid their base while they defend for the lols?
23:22:55 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: im up for some base raiding but this server makes it so hard 
23:23:50 : Side: Hank Scudder: How so?
23:23:59 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: you cant damage bases if the players are offline
23:24:17 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: and you cant tell if the people who own it are online or not
23:24:28 : Side: Hank Scudder: oh
23:24:51 : Side: Hank Scudder: I mean, what's the fun in raiding bases if there aren't defenders, yeah, but not being able to tell is frustrating.
23:24:52 : Side: BreadCrisp: itd be cool if the flag was raised when they were and lowered when they werent
23:24:58 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: yeah
23:25:07 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: but sometimes the flag is hidden
23:25:10 : Side: BreadCrisp: yea true
23:25:42 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: it just makes explosives obsolete if you barely get the chance to use them
23:25:44 : Side: Yannick: how do you get a door for a wood doorway?
23:26:02 : Side: BreadCrisp: check the recipes for the doorway
23:26:05 : Side: BreadCrisp: you can upgrade it
23:26:23 : Side: Yannick: oh so you need to upgrade it before you place it okay
23:26:27 : Side: BreadCrisp: yea
23:26:28 : Side: Hank Scudder: You can have other fun with explosives.... :V
23:26:54 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: i miss blowing into someones base and stealing everything though haha
23:27:24 : Side: Screw: but you can't if they have safes...
23:27:36 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: still is fun trying
23:27:43 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: safes are expensive too
23:27:45 : Side: wolf: any admins online?
23:27:55 : Side: Jason Abimbola: sometimes people dont invest in safes. cause they know that their walls/locked doors will keep their items safe
23:27:58 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: so most people just use crates and make it so people cant get in
23:28:01 : Side: Jason Abimbola: cause of the way base raiding is now
23:28:22 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: the base i just broke into didnt have any safes
23:28:24 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: just crates
23:28:42 : Side: Yannick: well i mean safes are expensive
23:28:48 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: you just gotta hope they have a kink in the defences and you can crawl under a wall ahha
23:29:43 : Side: Jimmy the Farmer: lol
23:29:59 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: or have placed a window badly so you can hop through it
23:30:12 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: though that is a glitch
23:30:33 : Side: |SGs| Jonty Fox: even though it makes perfect sense to be able to climb through a window like that
23:35:28 : Side: Jason Abimbola: how much do AI kills give you noe?
23:35:30 : Side: Jason Abimbola: now*
23:35:40 : Side: Yannick: depends on difficulty
